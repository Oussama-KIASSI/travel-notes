# Colombia

## Overview
Colombia is a nation of extraordinary contrasts—from Caribbean beaches to Andean peaks to Amazon jungle. The world's second most biodiverse country (after Brazil), Colombia contains 10% of Earth's species in just 1% of its land area. The colonial Spanish legacy blends with indigenous cultures (87 distinct ethnic groups) and Afro-Colombian communities along both coasts. Colombia's modern transformation from conflict to tourism destination is one of Latin America's greatest success stories. The 2016 peace agreement with FARC ended 52 years of civil conflict, opening previously inaccessible regions. Coffee culture defines the interior, while cumbia, vallenato, and salsa rhythms drive the coasts. Medellín's reinvention from the world's most dangerous city to an innovation hub symbolizes Colombia's national renewal.

## Historical Context
Pre-Columbian cultures included the Muisca (whose El Dorado legend inspired countless expeditions), Tayrona, Quimbaya, and San Agustín civilizations, renowned for gold work and monumental stone sculptures. Spanish conquest began in 1499; Cartagena became the richest port in the Spanish Empire. Independence came in 1819 under Simón Bolívar. The 20th century saw political violence (La Violencia 1948–1958 killed 200,000+), the rise of drug cartels (Pablo Escobar's Medellín Cartel in the 1980s–90s), and decades of guerrilla conflict (FARC, ELN). The 2000s Plan Colombia, combined with improved security, transformed major cities. The 2016 peace agreement (though narrow referendum approval) ended most FARC activity. Post-2016, Colombia opened to mass tourism. 2019–2024 saw continued stabilization, though pockets of violence persist in remote areas. The 2022 election of Gustavo Petro (former M-19 guerrilla; first leftist president) marked a political shift; his administration emphasizes social programs and environmental protection.

## Safety & Political Updates (2020–2025)
**COVID-19 Impact**: Colombia handled the pandemic with strict lockdowns (2020–2021). Tourism infrastructure fully recovered by 2023. Vaccination proof no longer required for entry as of 2024.

**Political Situation**: Gustavo Petro's presidency (2022–present) brought political change; focus on rural development and coca crop substitution programs. Democratic institutions stable. Peace process with ELN guerrillas ongoing but fragile. Some former FARC dissidents remain active in remote areas (primarily Caquetá, Putumayo, Nariño borders—not tourist regions).

**Safety for Travelers**: Major tourist destinations (Bogotá, Medellín, Cartagena, Coffee Region, Tayrona) are safe with standard urban precautions. Security improved dramatically since 2000s. Petty crime (phone theft, bag snatching) remains the main risk in cities. Use registered taxis or apps (Uber, InDriver, DiDi) exclusively. Avoid displaying expensive items. Don't walk alone in Bogotá's La Candelaria at night. Cartagena's Getsemaní and Walled City are well-policed. Medellín is remarkably safe; Comuna 13 tours during daytime only with reputable guides. Drug tourism (seeking cocaine) is illegal, dangerous, and funds violence. Solo women travelers report positive experiences with awareness. LGBT+ travelers: Colombia legalized same-sex marriage in 2016; major cities very welcoming; rural areas more conservative.
