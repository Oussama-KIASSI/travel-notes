# Venezuela

## Overview
Venezuela is a country of superlatives—home to the world's highest waterfall (Angel Falls), largest oil reserves, and some of the planet's most pristine wilderness. The country spans Caribbean coast, Andean peaks, vast llanos (plains), and the ancient Guiana Highlands' tepui formations (table-top mountains billions of years old). Venezuela's biodiversity rivals Brazil's, with jaguar, anaconda, capybara, and pink river dolphins. The nation has faced severe economic crisis since 2013, with hyperinflation, political instability, and mass emigration (7+ million Venezuelans abroad). Despite challenges, Venezuela's natural wonders—Angel Falls, Los Roques, Canaima—remain among South America's most spectacular. Tourism infrastructure is limited but adventure travelers find extraordinary experiences. The situation requires careful planning and realistic expectations about services.

## Historical Context
Indigenous peoples included Carib, Arawak, and Timoto-Cuica cultures. Columbus reached Venezuela in 1498; Spanish conquest began soon after. The name "Venezuela" (Little Venice) came from indigenous stilt houses over Lake Maracaibo. Venezuela was the birthplace of Simón Bolívar (born 1783 in Caracas), liberator of six South American countries. Independence achieved in 1821 after bloody wars. The 20th century transformed with oil discovery (1914); Venezuela became Latin America's richest nation by the 1950s. Political instability included military dictatorships and democratic periods. Hugo Chávez's "Bolivarian Revolution" (1999–2013) nationalized industries and implemented socialist policies; initially reduced poverty but left economy oil-dependent. After Chávez's death (2013), Nicolás Maduro's presidency coincided with oil price collapse. 2015–2023 saw hyperinflation (at one point 1,000,000% annually), economic collapse, food/medicine shortages, and political repression. 7+ million Venezuelans emigrated. 2020–2024: slight stabilization as economy partially dollarized; inflation decreased but remains high; political situation tense with disputed elections. Most Venezuelans live in poverty despite oil wealth. Tourism severely impacted but natural sites remain accessible through specialized operators.

## Safety & Political Updates (2020–2025)
**Political Situation (Critical)**: Nicolás Maduro remains president despite disputed elections and international recognition of opposition leaders. Economy partially dollarized (2020–present) with some stabilization. Services remain unreliable. Political protests occasional; avoid demonstrations. Authoritarian governance continues.

**Economic Reality**: Hyperinflation period ended but prices volatile. US dollars widely used. Bring all cash needed—ATMs unreliable, credit cards rarely work. Fuel shortages intermittent. Power outages common outside tourist zones. Internet connectivity poor.

**Safety for Travelers**:
- **Caracas**: High crime; avoid if possible; if necessary, airport transit only; don't explore city independently
- **Tourist areas (Los Roques, Canaima, Mérida)**: Relatively safer; organized tours essential; local operators manage logistics
- **General precautions**: Travel only with reputable tour companies; all Angel Falls/Canaima visits require guided tours (mandatory); bring all supplies (medicines, toiletries, snacks); shortages affect availability; petty crime common; violent crime risk in cities; register with embassy; check latest travel advisories
- **Border regions**: Avoid Colombian border (armed groups active); Brazil border (Roraima) also unstable

**Entry considerations**: Check visa requirements (changed frequently 2020–2024); tourist card usually issued on arrival; departure tax required; confirm current procedures with operators before booking.

**COVID-19**: Restrictions lifted 2023; healthcare system strained.

## Best Time to Visit
- **Canaima / Angel Falls** → Nov–May → dry season; Angel Falls most accessible; Jun–Oct → rainy season; falls run highest + most dramatic but river access can be difficult
- **Amazon (Amazonas State)** → Jun–Nov → lower water, better wildlife viewing on land; Dec–May → high water, canoe into flooded forest
- **Los Roques archipelago** → Dec–May → calmest seas + best diving; year-round warm (28°C)
- **Note** → check current travel advisories before visiting; political + security situation requires careful planning
