# Route 66 — USA

## Overview
The original American highway; 3,940 km (2,448 miles) from Chicago, Illinois to Santa Monica, California. Passes through 8 states: Illinois → Missouri → Kansas (13 miles) → Oklahoma → Texas → New Mexico → Arizona → California. The road was officially decommissioned in 1985 but survives as a network of Historic Route 66 frontage roads alongside the modern interstates. Allow 14–21 days for the full drive with proper stops; 10 days is possible but rushed. The road inspired Steinbeck's *Grapes of Wrath*, Kerouac's generation, Bobby Troup's song "(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66" and Pixar's *Cars*.

## Historical Context and Americana

**Birth of the Mother Road (1926)**: Route 66 was commissioned in 1926 as part of the U.S. Highway System—the first coordinated national road network. Cyrus Avery (the "Father of Route 66"), a Tulsa businessman, lobbied successfully to route the highway through Oklahoma, linking Chicago's industrial might to the Pacific Coast. The number "66" was chosen almost arbitrarily (originally proposed as Route 60, but that was taken by a Virginia-to-Missouri route). The road wasn't fully paved until 1938—the final stretch through northern Arizona was the last to be completed.

**The Dust Bowl Migration (1930s)**: Route 66 became the "Mother Road" during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl (1930–1939) when 2.5 million people fled the ecological catastrophe of the southern Great Plains. Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas suffered catastrophic topsoil loss from drought, over-farming and windstorms ("black blizzards"). Steinbeck's *The Grapes of Wrath* (1939) immortalized the Joad family's journey along Route 66 from Oklahoma to California—the road represented both desperation (fleeing poverty) and hope (California promised opportunity). The westward migration peaked in 1935–1940. California's agricultural valleys absorbed this labor force, though migrants faced hostility—called "Okies" as a slur, they lived in squalid migrant camps and competed for jobs at starvation wages.

**WWII and Post-War Boom (1941–1970)**: WWII mobilization moved millions of soldiers and materials along Route 66 to West Coast ports and training bases. After 1945, the post-war economic boom, cheap gasoline (15–30 cents/gallon), the rise of car culture (suburbanization, two-car families), and paid vacations created the American road trip. Route 66 became synonymous with freedom, mobility and prosperity. Bobby Troup's 1946 song "(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66" (famously covered by Nat King Cole, Chuck Berry, and the Rolling Stones) made the highway part of the American musical canon. The road spawned a commercial ecosystem: motor courts (precursors to motels), diners, roadside attractions (wigwams, dinosaurs, giant Paul Bunyans), neon signs, drive-in restaurants and the entire aesthetic of mid-century American roadside Googie architecture.

**The Interstate System and Decline (1956–1985)**: Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System (1956) marked the beginning of the end. The interstates—limited-access, high-speed, grade-separated highways—bypassed the small towns and commercial strips of Route 66. The last segment of Route 66 was bypassed in 1984 (Williams, Arizona, when I-40 opened). On June 27, 1985, Route 66 was officially decommissioned—road signs came down, the designation disappeared from maps. Towns along the route died overnight—motels closed, diners shuttered, gas stations went derelict. The road became a symbol of American obsolescence.

**Revival and Nostalgia (1990–present)**: In 1990, Route 66 was designated a "National Scenic Byway" and preservation efforts began. Angel Delgadillo (a barber in Seligman, Arizona) founded the Historic Route 66 Association in 1987 and fought tirelessly for recognition. Today, Route 66 is America's most famous heritage highway—a symbol of mid-century Americana, resilience, and the open road. The road's revival owes much to foreign tourists (especially Germans and Japanese) who romanticize American car culture. Pixar's *Cars* (2006) introduced Route 66 to a new generation—Radiator Springs is a composite of Seligman, Williams and other bypassed towns; Tow Mater was based on a rusted tow truck in Galena, Kansas.

**What Route 66 Represents**: Route 66 is America in microcosm—migration, opportunity, capitalism, obsolescence, nostalgia. It embodies American mythology: the open road as freedom; the West as possibility; the small-town café as community; the neon sign as art; the rejection of European density in favor of endless horizontal space. It's also a story of creative destruction: the interstates killed Route 66, but in doing so, they created the conditions for its nostalgic resurrection. The road's preservation is a form of anti-modernity—a rejection of speed and efficiency in favor of slowness and character.

**Modern Developments (2020–2025)**:
- **COVID-19 Impact (2020–2021)**: The pandemic devastated Route 66 tourism—small-town diners, motels and attractions rely entirely on visitor traffic. Many businesses closed permanently in 2020–2021. The Blue Swallow Motel (Tucumcari, NM) nearly closed; a GoFundMe campaign raised $50,000+ to keep it alive. Roy's Motel in Amboy, CA closed and remains shuttered (it's now privately owned and intermittently open). The recovery began in summer 2021 as Americans, unable to travel internationally, rediscovered domestic road trips—Route 66 saw record traffic in 2021–2022.
- **Federal Recognition (2021)**: In 2021, Congress introduced the "Route 66 National Historic Trail Act" to grant the road National Historic Trail status (like the Oregon Trail and Appalachian Trail). The bill has bipartisan support but has not yet passed. If approved, it would unlock federal preservation funding and formalize Route 66's status as a protected cultural landscape.
- **EV Charging Infrastructure (2022–2025)**: Electric vehicle charging stations began appearing along Route 66 in 2022–2024, particularly in New Mexico (state-funded EV corridor project) and California (Tesla Superchargers in Barstow, Kingman, Flagstaff). The longest charging gap is still Seligman, AZ to Kingman, AZ (70+ miles)—challenging for EVs with under 250-mile range. The federal government's EV charging expansion (part of the 2021 infrastructure bill) is slowly filling gaps, but Route 66's remoteness makes it one of the last U.S. highways to get full EV coverage.
- **Inflation and Rising Gas Prices (2021–2024)**: Gas prices peaked at $4–6/gallon in 2022 (the highest since 2008), making the Route 66 drive significantly more expensive. A full route now costs $400–600 in gas (depending on vehicle fuel efficiency). Budget travelers increasingly skip sections and use interstates to save fuel.
- **Preservation Wins**: The U-Drop Inn (Shamrock, TX) completed a full restoration in 2023 with state and private funding—the Art Deco tower and neon are pristine. The Munger Moss Motel (Lebanon, MO) was sold in 2021 to new owners committed to preservation (the previous owners operated it for 40+ years). Elmer's Bottle Tree Ranch (Oro Grande, CA) was donated to a preservation trust in 2019 after Elmer Long's death—it's now maintained by volunteers and remains free to visit.
- **The TikTok Effect (2022–2024)**: Route 66 went viral on TikTok and Instagram in 2022–2024, with influencers posting videos of Cadillac Ranch, the Wigwam Motels, and the Blue Whale of Catoosa. The demographic of Route 66 travelers has shifted younger (millennials and Gen Z) alongside the traditional Boomer road-trippers. Some businesses report 50%+ of visitors found them via social media. The downside: overtourism at the most Instagrammable spots (Cadillac Ranch is now crowded from sunrise to sunset in summer; the Blue Whale is overrun on weekends).

## State-by-State Highlights and Culture

**Illinois (Chicago to Missouri, ~470 km / 290 mi)**: The urban beginning transitions to Midwestern farmland. The Corn Belt begins outside Chicago—soybeans and corn dominate to the horizon. Small-town Illinois (Pontiac, Bloomington, Springfield) is politically conservative, economically struggling, and culturally proud. Abraham Lincoln's presence (he lived in Springfield 1844–1861) is everywhere—his home, his law office, his tomb. Illinois Route 66 is the most heavily restored section—murals, vintage signs and preserved buildings are everywhere.

**Missouri (St. Louis to Joplin, ~500 km / 310 mi)**: The Ozarks define southern Missouri—rolling forested hills, caves (over 6,000 documented caves in the state), rivers, and a distinct Appalachian-inflected culture. The Ozarks are hillbilly country (in the non-pejorative sense—independent, rural, Scots-Irish heritage). The region is Bible Belt—Baptist and Pentecostal churches dominate; alcohol sales were restricted in many counties until recently (some are still "dry"). The Meramec River valley (Devil's Elbow) is the most scenic stretch of Route 66 east of the Rockies. Missouri BBQ is a style unto itself—burnt ends, sweet sauces, and a rivalry between Kansas City (western MO) and St. Louis styles.

**Kansas (Galena to Baxter Springs, 21 km / 13 mi)**: The shortest section of Route 66 (only 13.2 miles) but culturally important. Kansas is Great Plains—flat, agricultural, and conservative. This tiny stretch was lead and zinc mining country (the Tri-State Mining District included Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma)—one of the world's richest lead-zinc deposits. Mining peaked 1900s–1950s; the industry died by 1970, leaving Galena and Baxter Springs economically depressed. The *Cars* connection revived Galena's tourism.

**Oklahoma (Joplin to Amarillo, ~650 km / 400 mi)**: The heart of Route 66—Oklahoma has more drivable miles of original alignment than any other state. The state is Native American country—39 federally recognized tribes, the highest number of any state (Oklahoma means "red people" in Choctaw). This was Indian Territory where the U.S. government forcibly relocated tribes (Trail of Tears, 1830s). The Land Run of 1889 opened the territory to white settlement—settlers raced to claim free land at noon on April 22, 1889 (hence Oklahoma's nickname "Sooner State"—some cheated and entered "sooner" than allowed). The Dust Bowl hit Oklahoma hardest—3.5 million acres of farmland destroyed. Oklahoma's oil industry boomed in the 1920s–30s (Tulsa was the "Oil Capital of the World"). Today, Oklahoma is deeply conservative (Trump won 65%+ in 2020), Bible Belt religious (Southern Baptist dominates), and economically mixed (oil, agriculture, aerospace, and poverty). The landscape shifts from green rolling hills in the east (the Ozark edge) to red earth plains in central Oklahoma to semi-arid shortgrass prairie in the west.

**Texas (Amarillo, 300 km / 186 mi in the Panhandle)**: The Texas Panhandle is High Plains—flat, treeless, ranching country at 3,500–4,000 feet elevation. This is cattle country—Amarillo is a major cattle auction and meatpacking center (the smell of feedlots permeates the air). The Panhandle is politically the most conservative part of Texas (Trump won 80%+ in some counties). Palo Duro Canyon State Park (the "Grand Canyon of Texas") is a geological anomaly in the flatness—the canyon cuts 800 feet deep into the plains. Cadillac Ranch (1974, by the Ant Farm art collective) and the Big Texan (1960, the 72-oz steak challenge) represent Texas's embrace of outsized spectacle. The Texas Panhandle was Comanche territory until the Red River War (1874–1875) destroyed Comanche power—the last free Plains Indians were forced onto reservations in Oklahoma.

**New Mexico (Tucumcari to Gallup, ~650 km / 400 mi)**: The most culturally distinct section of Route 66. New Mexico is 50% Hispanic (the highest percentage of any state), 11% Native American (Pueblo, Navajo, Apache), and deeply bicultural. Spanish is widely spoken. The landscape is high desert (Albuquerque sits at 5,300 feet)—pinyon and juniper forests, mesas, volcanic rock, and endless blue sky. New Mexico's light (thin atmosphere, high elevation) has attracted artists for a century—Georgia O'Keeffe, Ansel Adams, D.H. Lawrence all worked here. Santa Fe (founded 1610) is the oldest U.S. capital—older than Plymouth Rock. Taos Pueblo (1,000+ years old) is the longest continuously inhabited community in North America. Green chile is the state religion—New Mexico produces 60%+ of U.S. chile; Hatch, NM is the chile capital of the world. The state's culture is a mix of Pueblo, Spanish colonial, Mexican, Anglo and nuclear-age (Los Alamos, 60 miles from Santa Fe, developed the atomic bomb). New Mexico joined the U.S. in 1912 (47th state)—it was a territory for 64 years because Congress considered it "too Mexican."

**Arizona (Holbrook to California border, ~650 km / 400 mi)**: Northern Arizona is high desert and Colorado Plateau—Painted Desert badlands, petrified forests, ponderosa pine forests, volcanic fields, and the Grand Canyon. The section from Holbrook to Flagstaff crosses the Navajo Nation (the largest Native American reservation—27,000 square miles across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah). Flagstaff (7,000 feet elevation) is a mountain town—skiing, hiking, and a liberal college-town culture (Northern Arizona University). The section from Seligman to Oatman crosses the Black Mountains—the most dramatic and challenging drive on Route 66 (steep switchbacks, no guardrails, and wild burros in the road). Oatman is an authentic Old West ghost town—a gold rush boomtown (1915) that survived its own death. The Mojave Desert begins at the California border—one of North America's hottest, driest regions.

**California (Mojave Desert to Santa Monica, ~500 km / 315 mi)**: The final stretch crosses the Mojave Desert (Needles, Amboy, Barstow)—temperatures reach 120°F+ in summer; the original Route 66 alignment through Amboy is remote, desolate, and surreal. The Cajon Pass (I-15 through the San Gabriel Mountains) drops from 4,000 feet to sea level in 30 miles—the gateway to the Los Angeles basin. Route 66 enters LA through San Bernardino, Pasadena and Hollywood (Sunset Boulevard was part of the original alignment). The endpoint at Santa Monica Pier is anticlimactic—just another crowded beach in a sprawling metropolis—but the symbolism of reaching the Pacific after crossing the continent is real.

- **Devil's Rope Museum (McLean)** → a museum dedicated entirely to barbed wire; sounds absurd but is genuinely fascinating — hundreds of varieties of barbed wire on display, explaining how a simple invention transformed the American West, ended the open range and changed ranching forever; the adjacent Route 66 museum is a bonus; free/donation
- **Shamrock — U-Drop Inn** → the most beautiful Art Deco building on Route 66; a 1936 gas station and café with a soaring green-tiled tower; restored with federal funds; now a visitor center and gift shop; the building inspired Ramone's Body Art shop in Pixar's *Cars*; illuminated at night with green neon; free to visit

**Food**
- **Big Texan Steak Ranch** → see above; if not attempting the 72 oz challenge, the regular ribeye and T-bone are genuinely excellent; the rattlesnake bites appetizer is worth trying
- **MidPoint Café (Adrian)** → see above; the pies (especially the ugly crust pecan and the coconut cream) are the mandatory food stop on the Texas Panhandle
- **Golden Light Café (Amarillo)** → the oldest restaurant in Amarillo (1946); burgers, cold beer and live music in a tiny roadhouse; the green chile cheeseburger is excellent

**Nightlife**
- **Golden Light Café (Amarillo)** → live music most nights in the cramped bar next to the restaurant; country, blues and Americana; the most authentic night out in Amarillo
- **Sixth Street (Amarillo)** → a small but lively strip of bars and restaurants along the Route 66 corridor through downtown; nothing like Austin's Sixth Street, but a cold beer after a day of Panhandle driving is the point

- **Winslow, Arizona** → "Standin' on the Corner" — the Eagles lyric from *Take It Easy* (written about Winslow); a bronze statue and a commemorative mural mark the corner of Kinsley Avenue and 2nd Street; the most self-aware small-town tourist trap on the route; free and worth 20 minutes
- **Wigwam Motel #6 (Holbrook)** → one of only two surviving Wigwam Motels in America; 15 concrete teepee-shaped rooms arranged around a pool; built 1950; the most photographed accommodation on Route 66; staying here is the single most "Route 66" night of the trip; book months ahead; moderate prices; the rooms are small and basic but the setting is irreplaceable
- **Grand Canyon (South Rim)** → 1.5 hrs north of Williams on Route 64; the most visited natural wonder in America; 1.6 km deep, 16 km across, 446 km long; the scale makes photographs impossible to comprehend; the South Rim is open year-round; the Bright Angel Trail is the most accessible descent (hike down 3 miles to Indian Garden and back); book rim accommodation 6–13 months ahead for summer; the best views are at sunrise (Desert View Watchtower) and sunset (Hopi Point)
- **Seligman, Arizona** → the most perfectly preserved Route 66 town; the road bypassed Seligman in 1978 and time stopped; the barbershop of Angel Delgadillo — who fought harder than anyone to preserve Route 66 as a heritage route — is still operating; Angel (in his 90s) still meets visitors most mornings; the diner, the curio shops and the general atmosphere are the most authentic Route 66 experience left; free to explore

- **Jack Rabbit Trading Post (Joseph City)** → "HERE IT IS" — one of the most iconic advertising campaigns in American highway history; the giant jackrabbit silhouette and the yellow signs advertising it for hundreds of miles defined pre-interstate highway marketing; the trading post still operates and sells Route 66 memorabilia; free to photograph the rabbit
- **Walnut Canyon National Monument (near Flagstaff)** → cliff dwellings built by the Sinagua people 800+ years ago in a forested limestone canyon; a 1-mile loop trail descends into the canyon and passes 25 rooms built into the cliff overhangs; less crowded and more intimate than the better-known cliff dwellings in Colorado; allow 2 hours

- **Hotel Monte Vista (Flagstaff)** → a 1927 hotel bar with a haunted reputation; the neon sign is a Flagstaff landmark; the bar has an old-Hollywood atmosphere (John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable all stayed here)

---

## California — 1–2 days (Final Stretch)

**Attractions**
- **Mojave Desert crossing** → the most demanding section of the drive; the original alignment through Amboy, Essex and Chambless passes through some of the most desolate landscape in North America; the Amboy Crater (an extinct volcanic cinder cone) rises from the flat desert floor; Roy's Motel and Café in Amboy (a perfectly preserved 1938 desert gas station) is the most photogenic stop on this section; drive this section in early morning
- **Roy's Motel and Café (Amboy)** → the most iconic desert gas station on Route 66; the original 1938 buildings and the *Googie* (futuristic 1950s) architecture boomerang sign are extraordinary; no longer a working motel but the gas station + café is intermittently open; the landscape surrounding it — flat desert to the horizon in every direction — is one of the great American road trip views
- **Elmer's Bottle Tree Ranch (Oro Grande)** → over 200 "bottle trees" — metal poles topped with thousands of glass bottles, reflectors, gun parts and found objects — planted across the desert by Elmer Long; the bottles catch the sun and make music in the wind; free; one of the great pieces of desert folk art; Elmer has passed but the ranch is maintained and open
- **Barstow → San Bernardino** → the route becomes the Cajon Pass through the San Gabriel Mountains; the descent from 1,200 m into the Los Angeles basin gives the first views of the urban sprawl; the transition from desert to suburb is startling
- **Wigwam Motel #7 (Rialto/San Bernardino)** → the sister property to the Holbrook Wigwam Motel; 19 concrete teepees; less famous and slightly more rundown than the Arizona original, but the fact that both survive on the same route is remarkable; if you missed the Holbrook one, stay here
- **Santa Monica Pier (Mile 2,448)** → the official western terminus of Route 66; the "End of the Trail" sign at the foot of the pier; walking to the end of the pier and looking back east across the entire continent is a genuine emotional moment after driving the length of the road; the pier itself has a small amusement park, seafood restaurants and views of the Santa Monica Mountains; free to access

**Food**
- **In-N-Out Burger** → the California fast-food religion; the secret menu is the real menu — order "Animal Style" (grilled onions, mustard fried patty, extra spread, pickles); the first In-N-Out was on Route 66 in Baldwin Park (1948); a fundamental California experience
- **Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles (Los Angeles)** → the unlikely combination that defines LA soul food; crispy fried chicken on a waffle with syrup; the Obama special has made it famous; the Pico-Union location is the original
- **The Original Pantry Café (Downtown LA)** → open since 1924; claims to have never closed its doors (not once); a cash-only, no-reservations breakfast and lunch institution; the sourdough French toast and the T-bone steak breakfast are monuments to excess; lines form early
- **Tacos at any stand on the drive through East LA** → the Route 66 alignment through LA passes through some of the best taco territory in America; carne asada, al pastor, birria — pull over at any stand with a line of locals; this is the real final meal of the route

**Nightlife**
- **Santa Monica Pier** → the endpoint celebration; walk the pier at night when the amusement park lights are on and the Pacific is black below; street performers and carnival atmosphere; the "End of the Trail" sign is illuminated; the best beer in Santa Monica after the drive is at any bar on the 3rd Street Promenade (2 blocks inland)
- **Venice Beach Boardwalk** → a 20-minute walk south from the pier; the boardwalk after dark has bars, buskers and the lingering circus atmosphere that defines Venice; the Roosterfish and Townhouse are solid dive bar choices
- **The Bungalow (Santa Monica)** → a beachside cocktail bar in the Fairmont Miramar hotel; the outdoor patio with fire pits and ocean air is the upscale end-of-route celebration if the drive calls for it

## Practical Route Guide

**Direction** → Chicago → Santa Monica (west) is the classic direction and the traditional Route 66 direction; the morning sun is behind you crossing the deserts (crucial for photography and cooler driving)

**Distance + Pacing**
- Full route: ~3,940 km; 10 days minimum (long driving days); 14–21 days is comfortable
- Average daily drive: 250–400 km if stopping properly
- Do not try to cover the whole route in under 10 days — the stops between the famous landmarks are the real Route 66

**Navigation**
- The essential app is **Historic US Route 66** by Jerry McClanahan (based on the *EZ66 Guide for Travelers* book — buy the book; it covers every mile of original alignment)
- Google Maps will route you onto the interstate; always search for "Historic Route 66" or the specific road name in each state
- In some sections, the original alignment is unpaved (the Oklahoma section near McLean and the Arizona desert sections); passable in a standard car in dry weather

**Car Rental**
- Pick up Chicago, drop off Los Angeles ( for 14 days; one-way fees apply)
- An American car is strongly recommended for atmosphere: **Mustang**, **Camaro** or a full-size American SUV from any major rental company

**Accommodation**
- The surviving historic motels are the essential accommodation; Wigwam Motel (Holbrook), Blue Swallow Motel (Tucumcari, NM), Munger Moss Motel (Lebanon, MO), El Rancho Hotel (Gallup, NM) — book all 6+ months ahead for summer
- Budget option: most towns along the route have reliable chain motels (Super 8, Motel 6, Days Inn) at $50–90/night; perfectly functional but lacking the character of the historic motels
- Camping: KOA campgrounds and state park campgrounds exist at regular intervals; Palo Duro Canyon (TX), Petrified Forest (AZ) and several Missouri state parks have excellent campsites

---

## Tips — Route 66
- **Gas** → never pass a gas station in Arizona or New Mexico desert sections without filling up; stations can be 80+ km apart on the original alignment. The stretch from Seligman, AZ to Kingman, AZ (via Peach Springs) has no services for 50+ miles. Amboy, CA to Barstow, CA is 70+ miles with no guaranteed open stations.
- **Water** → carry 4+ litres per person in the car at all times in Arizona and California desert sections; summer temperatures + car trouble can be life-threatening. The Mojave Desert (Amboy, Essex, Chambless) regularly exceeds 120°F in July-August. Dehydration and heat stroke can occur within hours.
- **Speed** → US speed limits on Route 66 frontage roads are typically 45–65 mph (70–105 km/h); interstate speed limits are 75 mph in rural areas. Speed cameras exist in small towns (particularly Illinois and Missouri)—small towns fund themselves through traffic tickets. Fines are substantial ($200–500). Police radar is ubiquitous. Speeding through a small town is the easiest way to ruin your budget.
- **Cash** → many of the most authentic roadside stops are cash-only; keep $100+ in small bills at all times. ATMs exist in towns but not in remote areas. The Owl Bar (NM), Delgadillo's Snow Cap (AZ), and many vintage motels prefer or require cash.
- **Photography** → the best light for the classic neon-sign shots is at dusk (30 min after sunset) and dawn; the golden hour in the desert is extraordinary. The Blue Swallow Motel (Tucumcari, NM), the Wigwam Motels, and the U-Drop Inn (Shamrock, TX) are most photogenic at dusk when the neon is lit against the twilight sky. Sunrise at Cadillac Ranch (Amarillo, TX) gives the best light on the cars. Bring a DSLR or mirrorless camera—phone cameras struggle with night photography and long-distance desert landscapes.
- **Cell service** → spotty in rural areas; Verizon and AT&T have the best coverage. T-Mobile and Sprint are weaker in rural Midwest and desert sections. The Mojave Desert (Amboy to Barstow) and the stretch between Seligman and Kingman have long gaps without cell service. Download offline maps (Google Maps or Maps.me) before leaving cities.
- **Lodging** → book the iconic motels (Wigwam, Blue Swallow, Munger Moss, El Rancho) 6+ months ahead for summer. Chain motels (Super 8, Motel 6, Best Western) exist in every town with 10,000+ people—functional, clean, and $60–100/night. Avoid driving at night in remote areas—wildlife (deer, elk, cattle) on roads is a major hazard.
- **Route 66 vs. Interstates** → the original Route 66 alignment often parallels the interstate (I-55, I-44, I-40) but diverges into towns. The interstates are faster (70–80 mph) but sterile. Route 66 frontage roads are slower (45–55 mph) but where the culture is. Alternate between them—use interstates to cover ground, exit to Route 66 for towns and sights. The EZ66 Guide details every turn.
- **Must-eat** → green chile cheeseburger (New Mexico—The Owl Bar's is legendary), Chicago deep-dish pizza (Lou Malnati's or Giordano's), Oklahoma BBQ (Rib Crib or any local joint with a smoker out back), Navajo taco (fry bread with beans and chile—sold on the Navajo Nation in Arizona), Texas brisket (Big Texan or Golden Light Café in Amarillo), Arizona Sonoran hot dog (bacon-wrapped, mayo, beans—a Tucson specialty but found in Flagstaff), In-N-Out Animal Style (California—order "Animal Style fries" for fries with cheese, grilled onions and spread), Ted Drewes frozen custard (St. Louis—the "concrete" is thick enough to hold upside-down), MidPoint Café pies (Adrian, TX—the ugly crust pies are extraordinary)
- **Must-drink** → a root beer float at a 1950s diner (Cruisers Cafe 66 in Williams, AZ or any vintage diner), an Oklahoma Coors or local craft beer at a roadside bar (Elbow Inn in Devil's Elbow, MO), New Mexico craft beer (Santa Fe Brewing, La Cumbre or Marble Brewery in Albuquerque), a drive-in milkshake (hand-spun, preferably chocolate or strawberry), sweet tea in Missouri and Oklahoma (Southern influence), horchata in New Mexico (Mexican rice drink), Mexican Coke (made with cane sugar, not corn syrup—available at gas stations in NM and AZ)
- **Cultural notes** → the American road trip is an institution. Conversations with strangers at diners, gas stations and motels are expected—Americans on Route 66 are friendly and talkative. Talking about politics or religion is risky—Route 66 crosses deep red (Republican) America; rural Oklahoma, Texas and Arizona are Trump country. Respect for veterans and the military is universal. Tipping is mandatory—15–20% in diners and restaurants, $1–2 per drink at bars, $1–2 per bag for hotel porters. Americans are loud, direct and informal—first names are used immediately, and "How are you?" is a greeting, not a genuine question (answer "Good, you?" not a detailed health update).
- **Books + media** → *The Grapes of Wrath* (Steinbeck, 1939) — the defining Route 66 novel; read it before the trip. *On the Road* (Kerouac, 1957) — the Beat Generation road trip; captures the restless American spirit. *EZ66 Guide for Travelers* (Jerry McClanahan) — the essential practical guide; covers every mile with maps and GPS coordinates; buy the physical book or download the app. *Route 66: The Mother Road* (Michael Wallis, 1990) — the definitive history. The Pixar film *Cars* (2006) was almost entirely inspired by Route 66 towns (Radiator Springs = Seligman + Williams; Tow Mater = the tow truck in Galena, KS; Flo's V8 Café = MidPoint Café; the Cozy Cone Motel = Wigwam Motels). The song "(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66" (Bobby Troup, 1946) is the road's anthem—listen to Nat King Cole's version (1946), Chuck Berry's rock version (1961) or the Rolling Stones' cover (1964).
- **Safety** → the US is safe but isolated rural areas can be risky. Lock car doors and don't leave valuables visible in the car (smash-and-grab theft exists in every city). Small-town America is generally very safe—violent crime is rare, but petty theft exists. Wildlife is a hazard—deer, elk and cattle on roads at dawn and dusk cause fatal accidents. Never approach wild animals (bison in Oklahoma, elk in New Mexico/Arizona, rattlesnakes in deserts). In the Mojave Desert, abandoned buildings and mines are hazardous—floors collapse, snakes nest inside. The remote desert sections (Amboy, Oatman) require preparation—car breakdown in 120°F heat is life-threatening.
- **Emergency** → 911 (all emergency services); in remote desert sections cell coverage can be absent for long stretches — carry a backup satellite communicator (Garmin inReach or SPOT). Road assistance (AAA—American Automobile Association) is highly recommended for breakdowns. US healthcare is expensive—buy travel insurance covering medical emergencies (a broken leg can cost $10,000+; an ambulance ride is $1,000–3,000). Emergency rooms are legally required to treat you regardless of ability to pay, but you will receive a bill.
- **Costs** → budget $150–250/day per person (mid-range motels, sit-down meals, gas, attractions). Gas is $3–5/gallon (depending on state and year); a typical car gets 25–30 mpg; the full route requires 80–100 gallons = $240–500 in gas. Motels range $60 (Super 8 in small towns) to $200+ (Wigwam Motels, El Rancho Hotel). Diner meals are $10–15; sit-down restaurants $20–40 per person. National Park entry fees are $20–35 per vehicle (Petrified Forest, Grand Canyon). Budget extra for souvenirs—Route 66 kitsch is irresistible.
