## Paris — 4–5 days

### Historical Context
Paris has been continuously inhabited for over 2,000 years, beginning as Lutetia, a Roman settlement on the Île de la Cité. The city became the royal capital under Hugh Capet (987 AD) and reached its artistic zenith during the Belle Époque (1871-1914). The French Revolution (1789) reshaped European political thought here, while the Haussmann renovations (1853-1870) created the wide boulevards and uniform architecture that define modern Paris. The city holds 4 UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Banks of the Seine, Palace of Versailles, Palace and Park of Fontainebleau, and Provins (medieval fair town).

**Food**

### Culinary Heritage
French cuisine became the foundation of Western fine dining through *haute cuisine* (18th-19th c) and *nouvelle cuisine* (1960s-70s). Auguste Escoffier codified French cooking in *Le Guide Culinaire* (1903). UNESCO recognized the French gastronomic meal as Intangible Cultural Heritage (2010). Regional diversity is paramount: butter in the north, olive oil in the south; Burgundy for beef, Brittany for seafood and crêpes, Lyon for charcuterie, Provence for vegetables and herbs. The *terroir* philosophy—that food expresses its place—shapes everything. The AOC system (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) protects regional products: only sparkling wine from Champagne can be called Champagne; Roquefort cheese must be aged in the caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon. Post-2020, there's been a strong movement toward *néo-bistrots* (modern bistros) using hyper-local seasonal ingredients, natural wines, and relaxed service.

- **Le Relais de l'Entrecôte** → no reservations, no menu choices — you get one thing: *entrecôte* (rib-eye steak) with their famous secret walnut sauce and unlimited shoestring fries; served in two rounds; queue before opening (they don't take bookings); the most satisfying meal in Paris for under
- **Bouillon Pigalle** → the revival of the classic Parisian *bouillon* (worker's canteen); enormous dining room, fast service, authentic French brasserie food at remarkably low prices; *œuf mayonnaise*, *bœuf bourguignon*, *profiteroles*; queue or go at off-hours; one of the best value meals in Paris
- **Classic French bistro essentials** → *steak frites* (the bistro staple since the 1930s), *croque monsieur* (invented 1910 in a Paris café), *soupe à l'oignon gratinée* (French onion soup with gruyère crouton — a Les Halles market tradition), *cuisses de grenouilles* (frog legs sautéed in garlic butter — eaten in France since the 12th c), *escargots de Bourgogne* (Burgundy snails with garlic-parsley butter since the 19th c), *crème brûlée* (caramelized custard, origins debated between France and England), *tarte tatin* (upside-down caramelized apple tart invented by accident at Hôtel Tatin, Loire Valley, 1880s)
- **L'As du Fallafel** (Rue des Rosiers, Le Marais) → the most famous falafel in Paris; the queue moves fast; eat it standing on the street; the aubergine and fried eggplant version is excellent; cash only; closed Friday evening + Saturday
- **Café de Flore / Les Deux Magots** (Saint-Germain) → the most famous literary cafés in the world; Sartre, de Beauvoir, Hemingway, Picasso all had their tables here; expensive by Paris café standards, but have one *café crème* and a *croissant* for the atmosphere

- **Rue Montorgueil** → the most authentic food market street in central Paris; cheese, charcuterie, fresh pasta, oysters, boulangeries — a complete Parisian food education on one pedestrianized street
- **Kahvaltı (French breakfast)** → the *petit déjeuner* ritual: *café au lait* or *café crème* + fresh *croissant* (or *pain au chocolat*) from any good *boulangerie*; this is how Paris starts every morning

**Nightlife**
- **Latin Quarter** → the most atmospheric evening neighborhood; bars and brasseries on Rue de la Huchette, Rue Mouffetard and the surrounding medieval streets; best for a long, unhurried evening drink with no particular destination; the jazz clubs on Rue des Lombards are some of the best in Europe

- **Pigalle / South Pigalle (SoPi)** → the neighborhood below Montmartre; the most interesting bar scene in Paris currently; craft cocktail bars, natural wine bars and jazz venues; **Le Carmen** (in Bizet's former house) and **Dirty Dick** (tiki bar) are standouts
- **Canal Saint-Martin** → the trendy canal neighborhood northeast of the Marais; wine bars, craft beer spots and outdoor terraces; the most local, least-touristy nightlife area in Paris
- **Moulin Rouge** → the legendary cabaret (1889); the original cancan; expensive dinner-and-show packages, but the revue alone (from) is worth it for the spectacle at least once; book ahead months in advance

## Tips — France
- **Language** → French; speaking even basic French (*bonjour*, *s'il vous plaît*, *merci*) is genuinely appreciated and changes the reception; defaulting immediately to English without trying French first is considered rude
- **Transport** → Métro is fast, cheap and covers everything; buy a *carnet* (10-trip book) or use contactless card; for Versailles, RER C from central Paris; book intercity TGV trains in advance on SNCF for the best prices
- **Museum bookings** → the Louvre, Versailles, Musée d'Orsay, Sainte-Chapelle all require timed entry booked in advance in peak season; do not show up without tickets and expect to get in quickly
- **Meal times** → lunch 12–2:30 PM; dinner 7:30–10:30 PM; kitchens close firmly at these times; arriving outside them will get you turned away at serious restaurants
- **Tipping** → *service compris* (service charge included) is legally required on all French restaurant bills; leaving an extra for good service is appreciated but never expected
- **Boulangeries** → the cornerstone of Parisian daily life; a *baguette tradition* costs and is the best bread in the world; buy one every morning; the law mandates that bread must be made on-site
- **Must-eat** → *steak frites*, *croque monsieur*, *soupe à l'oignon*, *escargots*, *bœuf bourguignon*, *crème brûlée*, *macarons* (Pierre Hermé), *croissant* (from a proper boulangerie — not a café)
- **Must-drink** → *kir royale* (crème de cassis + Champagne; the classic aperitif), *Bordeaux* (Cabernet Sauvignon blends; the most famous wine region), *Burgundy* (the world's greatest Pinot Noir + Chardonnay), *Champagne* (drink it in Champagne if you visit the region), *pastis* (anise spirit with water; the south of France afternoon drink)
- **Safety** → Paris is generally safe; pickpockets operate heavily around the Eiffel Tower, Champs-Élysées, Sacré-Cœur and on the Métro; keep bags in front and phones in pockets in these areas
- **Emergency** → 15 (medical SAMU), 17 (police), 18 (fire), 112 (EU emergency number)
