## Paris — 4–5 days

### Historical Context
Paris has been continuously inhabited for over 2,000 years, beginning as Lutetia, a Roman settlement on the Île de la Cité. The city became the royal capital under Hugh Capet (987 AD) and reached its artistic zenith during the Belle Époque (1871-1914). The French Revolution (1789) reshaped European political thought here, while the Haussmann renovations (1853-1870) created the wide boulevards and uniform architecture that define modern Paris. The city holds 4 UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Banks of the Seine, Palace of Versailles, Palace and Park of Fontainebleau, and Provins (medieval fair town).

**Food**

### Culinary Heritage
French cuisine became the foundation of Western fine dining through *haute cuisine* (18th-19th c) and *nouvelle cuisine* (1960s-70s). Auguste Escoffier codified French cooking in *Le Guide Culinaire* (1903). UNESCO recognized the French gastronomic meal as Intangible Cultural Heritage (2010). Regional diversity is paramount: butter in the north, olive oil in the south; Burgundy for beef, Brittany for seafood and crêpes, Lyon for charcuterie, Provence for vegetables and herbs. The *terroir* philosophy—that food expresses its place—shapes everything. The AOC system (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) protects regional products: only sparkling wine from Champagne can be called Champagne; Roquefort cheese must be aged in the caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon. Post-2020, there's been a strong movement toward *néo-bistrots* (modern bistros) using hyper-local seasonal ingredients, natural wines, and relaxed service.
