# Spain

### Historical & Cultural Context
Spain's identity was forged by 2,800 years of successive civilizations layering over each other: Phoenicians and Greeks (1st millennium BC), Romans (218 BC - 476 AD who gave Spain its language and roads), Visigoths (5th-8th c), Moors (711-1492 who left the greatest Islamic architecture in Europe), and Catholic kingdoms. The Reconquista (Christian reconquest, 722-1492) took 770 years and ended with Granada's fall. 1492 was Spain's *annus mirabilis*: Columbus reached America, Granada fell, Jews were expelled, and Spain became Europe's superpower. The Spanish Golden Age (16th-17th c) produced Cervantes (*Don Quixote*, 1605-1615), Velázquez, and Goya. Spain has 50 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (3rd most in the world after Italy and China). Regional identity is fiercely maintained: Catalonia, Basque Country, and Galicia have distinct languages, cultures, and independence movements. Spanish culture gave the world flamenco (UNESCO Intangible Heritage), tapas, *siesta*, bullfighting (declining since 2010s), Picasso, Dalí, Gaudí, and Almodóvar. The Civil War (1936-39) and Franco dictatorship (1939-1975) still shape Spanish politics. *La Movida Madrileña* (1980s cultural explosion after Franco) created modern Spanish identity.

### Madrid's History
Madrid became Spain's capital only in 1561 (Felipe II moved it from Toledo) and is Europe's highest capital (667m altitude). The city has no Roman ruins or medieval core — it was a minor Moorish fortress (*Magerit*) until the 16th c. Madrid's greatness came from serving the Spanish Empire (16th-19th c). The *Prado, Reina Sofía, and Thyssen* museums form the "Golden Triangle of Art" — the greatest concentration of European masterpieces outside Paris. Madrid has 2 UNESCO Sites: *El Escorial* (royal monastery-palace 50km away) and the *Landscape of Light* (Prado-Retiro cultural landscape, 2021).

## Barcelona — 4 days

### Catalonian Capital & Modernisme
Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia (*Catalunya*), a nation within Spain with its own language (Catalan), parliament, and fierce independence movement. The city was a Roman colony (*Barcino*, 15 BC); medieval walls survive in the Gothic Quarter. Barcelona's golden age came twice: as a Mediterranean trading power (13th-15th c) and during the *Modernisme* movement (Catalan Art Nouveau, 1888-1911) when Gaudí, Domènech i Montaner, and Puig i Cadafalch transformed the city. The 1992 Olympics opened Barcelona to the sea and created modern Barceloneta. Today Barcelona has 9 UNESCO Sites (more than any city except Rome): Gaudí's works (Sagrada Família, Park Güell, Casa Milà, Casa Vicens, Casa Batlló, Colònia Güell crypt), Palau de la Música Catalana, and Hospital de Sant Pau.

- **Casa Milà / La Pedrera (UNESCO)** → Gaudí's last civilian building (1906-1912); *La Pedrera* means "the stone quarry" (locals mocked its wavy stone facade); the undulating facade has no load-bearing walls (revolutionary for 1906); natural ventilation and light in every apartment; the rooftop with warrior chimney-stacks (28 chimneys disguised as sculptures) is the highlight; the attic catenary arches (using hanging chain models inverted) demonstrate Gaudí's engineering; excellent Gaudí exhibition inside showing his working methods

## Tips — Spain
- **Language** → Spanish (*Castellano*) everywhere; Catalan widely spoken and proudly used in Barcelona + Catalonia; a few words of Catalan (*gràcies*, *bon dia*) are warmly received; English is widely spoken in tourist areas
- **Transport** → Madrid Metro is excellent + cheap; Barcelona Metro + bus cover the whole city; Renfe AVE high-speed train Madrid→Barcelona takes ~2h45 and is the best option (faster + cheaper than flying once you factor in airport time)
- **Meal times** → lunch is the main meal (2–4 PM); dinner rarely before 9–10 PM; don't arrive at a restaurant at 7 PM and expect it to be open; adapt or eat tourist food
- **Tapas** → in Madrid, many bars still give a free tapa with each drink (especially in La Latina + Malasaña); in Barcelona, you pay for everything; the best tapas are at the bar, not at a table
- **Tipping** → not obligatory; rounding up or leaving per person at sit-down restaurants is appreciated; not expected at bars
- **Siesta** → smaller shops and non-tourist businesses still close 2–5 PM; plan accordingly
- **Safety** → Barcelona has a significant pickpocket problem, especially on La Rambla, the Metro + around Sagrada Família; keep bags in front, use a money belt on public transport; Madrid is generally safer
- **Must-eat** → *pa amb tomàquet* (Catalan bread with tomato, olive oil, salt — the foundation of Catalan cuisine since 18th c), *croquetas de jamón* (béchamel croquettes with ham, invented in France, perfected in Spain), *patatas bravas* (fried potatoes with spicy tomato sauce and aioli), *jamón ibérico de bellota* (acorn-fed Iberian ham, cured 36+ months — world's finest ham), *pintxos* (Basque elaborate toothpick tapas — originated San Sebastián), *fideuà* (Valencian noodle paella invented 1960s), *crema catalana* (custard with burnt sugar crust — Catalonia's answer to *crème brûlée*, documented since 14th c)
- **Must-drink** → *cava* (Catalan sparkling wine; better value than Champagne), *vermut* (vermouth; the Sunday morning ritual in Madrid), *txakoli* (Basque white wine; with pintxos), *clara* (beer with lemon; the Spanish shandy)
