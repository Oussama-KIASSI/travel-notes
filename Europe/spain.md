# Spain

### Historical & Cultural Context
Spain's identity was forged by 2,800 years of successive civilizations layering over each other: Phoenicians and Greeks (1st millennium BC), Romans (218 BC - 476 AD who gave Spain its language and roads), Visigoths (5th-8th c), Moors (711-1492 who left the greatest Islamic architecture in Europe), and Catholic kingdoms. The Reconquista (Christian reconquest, 722-1492) took 770 years and ended with Granada's fall. 1492 was Spain's *annus mirabilis*: Columbus reached America, Granada fell, Jews were expelled, and Spain became Europe's superpower. The Spanish Golden Age (16th-17th c) produced Cervantes (*Don Quixote*, 1605-1615), Velázquez, and Goya. Spain has 50 UNESCO World Heritage Sites (3rd most in the world after Italy and China). Regional identity is fiercely maintained: Catalonia, Basque Country, and Galicia have distinct languages, cultures, and independence movements. Spanish culture gave the world flamenco (UNESCO Intangible Heritage), tapas, *siesta*, bullfighting (declining since 2010s), Picasso, Dalí, Gaudí, and Almodóvar. The Civil War (1936-39) and Franco dictatorship (1939-1975) still shape Spanish politics. *La Movida Madrileña* (1980s cultural explosion after Franco) created modern Spanish identity.

### Madrid's History
Madrid became Spain's capital only in 1561 (Felipe II moved it from Toledo) and is Europe's highest capital (667m altitude). The city has no Roman ruins or medieval core — it was a minor Moorish fortress (*Magerit*) until the 16th c. Madrid's greatness came from serving the Spanish Empire (16th-19th c). The *Prado, Reina Sofía, and Thyssen* museums form the "Golden Triangle of Art" — the greatest concentration of European masterpieces outside Paris.

## Barcelona — 4 days

Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia (*Catalunya*), a nation within Spain with its own language (Catalan), parliament, and fierce independence movement. The city was a Roman colony (*Barcino*, 15 BC); medieval walls survive in the Gothic Quarter. Barcelona's golden age came twice: as a Mediterranean trading power (13th-15th c) and during the *Modernisme* movement (Catalan Art Nouveau, 1888-1911) when Gaudí, Domènech i Montaner, and Puig i Cadafalch transformed the city. The 1992 Olympics opened Barcelona to the sea and created modern Barceloneta. Today Barcelona has 9 UNESCO Sites (more than any city except Rome): Gaudí's works (Sagrada Família, Park Güell, Casa Milà, Casa Vicens, Casa Batlló, Colònia Güell crypt), Palau de la Música Catalana, and Hospital de Sant Pau.
