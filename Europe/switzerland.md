## Tips — Switzerland
- **Language** → four national languages: German (spoken as Swiss German dialect in the north and east), French (west), Italian (Ticino, south), Romansh (Graubünden); English is widely spoken everywhere; attempt the local language of the region you're in
- **Transport** → the Swiss Travel Pass is excellent value: unlimited travel on trains, buses, boats and city transport + free museum entry; 3/4/6/8/15-day versions; the Swiss rail system is the most punctual and efficient in the world; buy the pass before arrival
- **Cost** → Switzerland is expensive; budget CHF 50–80 per meal at a sit-down restaurant; a beer costs CHF 7–9; accommodation CHF 150–400/night; the Swiss Travel Pass and supermarket meals (Coop and Migros are excellent) help manage costs
- **Tipping** → service is included in all bills by law; rounding up or leaving 5–10% at restaurants is appreciated but never expected
- **Must-eat** → *fondue* (the national dish), *raclette*, *rösti* (crispy shredded potato cake; originally a Bern farmers' breakfast), *Zürcher Geschnetzeltes* (Zurich sliced veal), *Bündnerfleisch* (air-dried beef from Graubünden), *Birchermüesli* (invented in Zurich by Dr. Bircher-Benner, c. 1900), Swiss chocolate (Lindt, Sprüngli, Läderach, Cailler)

- **Hiking** → Switzerland has 65,000 km of marked trails; the yellow signposts are everywhere and always accurate; difficulty grades: yellow = hiking, red-white-red = mountain hiking (some exposure), blue-white-blue = alpine (technical, experience required); the trails are the best-maintained in the world
- **Safety** → Switzerland is one of the safest countries in the world; mountain safety requires respect for weather (conditions change rapidly above 2,000 m; always check forecasts); cable cars and mountain railways have seasonal schedules — verify before going
- **Emergency** → 112 (EU emergency), 117 (police), 118 (fire), 144 (ambulance), 1414 (REGA mountain rescue)
