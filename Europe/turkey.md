# Turkey

### Historical & Cultural Context
Turkey sits at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, controlling the strategic waterways (Bosphorus, Dardanelles) between the Black Sea and Mediterranean for millennia. Anatolia (Asian Turkey) is one of humanity's oldest continuously inhabited regions: Göbekli Tepe (11,000 BC) is the world's oldest temple. Turkey was home to the Hittites (1600-1178 BC), Troy (3000-500 BC), Greek colonies, the Kingdom of Lydia (where coins were invented, 7th c BC), Alexander's empire, and Roman/Byzantine rule for 1,500 years. Constantinople (modern Istanbul) was capital of the Eastern Roman Empire (330-1453 AD) and the Orthodox Christian world. The Ottoman Empire (1299-1922) ruled from Vienna to Yemen, Baghdad to Algeria for 600 years — one of history's longest-lasting empires. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk founded modern Turkey (1923) from the empire's ruins, secularized the state, changed the alphabet from Arabic to Latin, and gave women the vote (1934, before France). Turkey has 21 UNESCO World Heritage Sites spanning 11,000 years. Turkish culture synthesizes Central Asian nomadic traditions, Persian aesthetics, Greek philosophy, Islamic art, and European modernism. Coffee, tulips, and croissants all came to Europe from Turkey.

## Istanbul — 2 days

### Constantinople/Istanbul — The City on Two Continents
Istanbul is the only city on two continents (Europe and Asia, divided by the Bosphorus strait). As Constantinople, it was capital of the Roman Empire (330-395), Byzantine Empire (395-1204, 1261-1453), Latin Empire (1204-1261), and Ottoman Empire (1453-1922). The city survived 23 sieges over 1,600 years. When Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (May 29, 1453), it ended the Middle Ages. The *Historic Areas of Istanbul* (UNESCO, 1985) encompass four zones: Archaeological Park (Hagia Sophia, Topkapi), Süleymaniye, Zeyrek, and the city walls. The city has 3,000 mosques, 17 palaces, and held 13-15 million people (exact count unknown). Istanbul synthesizes 2,700 years: Greek Byzantion (667 BC), Roman Constantinople, Byzantine Christianity, Ottoman Islam, and secular Turkish modernity.

## Cappadocia — 2 days

### Cappadocia's Geological & Historical Wonder (UNESCO)
Cappadocia's landscape was formed by volcanic eruptions 3-9 million years ago. Mount Erciyes and Mount Hasan covered the region in ash (*tuff*), which hardened into soft rock. Erosion carved this into "fairy chimneys" (cone-shaped rock formations). Early Christians fleeing Roman persecution (3rd-4th c AD) carved entire cities into the rock. The *Göreme National Park and Rock Sites of Cappadocia* (UNESCO, 1985) encompasses the valleys and underground cities. By the Byzantine era (7th-13th c), thousands of rock-cut churches with frescoes covered the region. Cappadocia remained Christian until the 1923 Greek-Turkish population exchange emptied the caves permanently.

At its height (1st-2nd c AD), 250,000 people lived here, making it the 2nd largest city in the Roman Empire after Rome. The Temple of Artemis (550 BC) was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World — only fragments remain. St Paul lived in Ephesus (52-54 AD) and wrote his Letter to the Ephesians here. The Virgin Mary is believed to have spent her final years here. The Council of Ephesus (431 AD) established Mary as "Mother of God" in Christian doctrine. The city was abandoned after the harbor silted up (7th c AD). *Ephesus (UNESCO, 2015)* encompasses the city ruins, Temple of Artemis, House of Virgin Mary, and St John's Basilica.

## Pamukkale — 1 day (day trip from Izmir or Denizli)

The terraces are 2,700m long, 160m high, visible from 20km away. *Hierapolis-Pamukkale (UNESCO, 1988)* protects both the natural formations and the ancient city. Hierapolis was founded 190 BC by the King of Pergamon as a spa resort — the thermal waters were believed to have healing properties. The city reached 100,000 people during the Roman period. St Philip was martyred here (87 AD); his tomb (discovered 2011) is in the archaeological site.

## Troy — 1 day (day trip from Çanakkale)

### Troy — Homer's Epic Made Real (UNESCO)
Troy was long thought to be mythological until Heinrich Schliemann excavated the site (1871-1890), proving the city existed. *Archaeological Site of Troy (UNESCO, 1998)* encompasses 4,000 years of occupation: Troy I-V (3000-1700 BC, Bronze Age settlements), Troy VI (1700-1250 BC, the probable Homeric Troy based on fortification scale), Troy VII (1250-1000 BC, destroyed by fire ca. 1180 BC, possibly the actual Trojan War date), Troy VIII-IX (Greek and Roman cities). The Trojan War (if historical) occurred during the Bronze Age Collapse (1200-1100 BC) when Mediterranean civilizations fell. Homer composed the *Iliad* ca. 750 BC, 400+ years after the war — blending myth, history, and poetic invention. The tale of the Trojan Horse, Achilles, Hector, and Helen has shaped Western literature for 2,800 years.

**Attractions**
- **Troy Archaeological Site (UNESCO)** → Homer's *Iliad* city; 4,500 years of continuous occupation; nine civilizations in stratified excavations

### Recent Tourism Changes (2020-2025)
Turkey's tourism recovered strongly post-2020. Istanbul opened a new airport (Istanbul Airport, 2019, world's largest by terminal size) replacing Atatürk. Istanbul's Museum Pass expanded to include 12 major sites (2023). Hagia Sophia's reconversion to mosque (2020) limited non-prayer-time visits. Göbekli Tepe opened a new visitor center (2024). Cappadocia introduced balloon flight caps (150 balloons max daily, 2023) after safety concerns. Digital QR guide systems installed at major sites (2023-2024). Turkey launched "TurkishTrails" app (2024) consolidating regional tourism info.

## Tips — Turkey
- **Visa** → e-Visa at evisa.gov.tr; do not use third-party sites; takes minutes
- **Currency** → Turkish Lira (TRY); cards accepted in cities; carry cash for markets, small restaurants, rural areas
  - ATMs widely available; avoid airport exchange (poor rates)
- **Bargaining** → expected in bazaars/souvenir shops; never in restaurants, hotels, modern shops
  - Opening offer typically 2–3x; counter at 40–50%; walking away often improves the offer
- **Dress code** → modest in all mosques (shoulders + knees covered; women need headscarf; shoes removed)
  - More conservative in Konya + interior; coastal resorts are casual
- **Language** → Turkish; English widely spoken in Istanbul + tourist areas; less so inland
  - Useful: *merhaba* (hello), *tesekkür ederim* (thank you), *lütfen* (please)
- **Must-eat** → *lahmacun* (thin meat flatbread), *manti* (tiny beef dumplings with yogurt + butter), *imam bayildi* (stuffed aubergine), *köfte* (meatballs; hundreds of regional variations), *balik ekmek*, *baklava* (Gaziantep claims the best), *künefe* (shredded phyllo with cheese in syrup; Hatay specialty), *çig köfte* (raw bulgur rolls; now usually vegetarian; Sanliurfa origin)
- **Must-drink** → *çay* (tea in tulip glass; Turks drink 3.5 kg/capita annually; declining is rude — accept at least one), *Turkish coffee* (thick, unfiltered; UNESCO 2013; fortune-telling from grounds), *ayran* (yogurt + water + salt), *raki* (anise spirit; dilute with water = milky "lion's milk"; traditional meyhane drink), *salep* in winter (orchid root hot drink + cinnamon), *salgam suyu* (fermented turnip juice; Adana specialty)
- **Safety** → generally safe; normal market precautions; avoid political demonstrations; check advisories for southeastern provinces
  - Coastal + historic tourist areas are very safe
