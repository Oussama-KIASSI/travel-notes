## Tips — Portugal
- **Language** → Portuguese; English widely spoken in Lisbon, Porto, tourist areas; less so in rural interior
  - Any Portuguese is warmly appreciated; do not attempt Spanish — considered condescending
- **Transport** → Lisbon + Porto have excellent metro; suburban trains for Sintra + Cascais
  - Intercity trains (CP) + Rede Expressos buses connect major cities
  - Driving in Lisbon is chaotic, parking nearly impossible; Algarve best by car
- **Tipping** → not obligatory; rounding up or 5–10% at sit-down restaurants is appreciated
- **Fado** → essential live experience; avoid tourist shows on Rua das Portas de Santo Antão
  - Authentic venues in Alfama + Madragoa; Coimbra fado is a different style (male voices, academic tradition)
- **Bacalhau** → salt cod; cornerstone of Portuguese cuisine; said to have 365 recipes
  - *Bacalhau à brás* (shredded with eggs + potato sticks), *à Gomes de Sá* (potatoes, olives, egg), *com natas* (with cream)
- **Must-eat** → *pastéis de nata*, *francesinha* (Porto), *cataplana* (Algarve), *bacalhau à brás*, *caldo verde* (kale + sausage soup), *ameijoas à bulhão pato* (clams in garlic + coriander), *leitão* (roast suckling pig; best in Bairrada), *tripas à moda do Porto* (tripe; the city's nickname is *tripeiros*)
- **Must-drink** → *vinho verde* (young, slightly fizzy white; Minho), *port wine* (10- or 20-year tawny as aperitif), *Alentejo reds* (full-bodied, earthy), *ginjinha* (sour cherry liqueur; from chocolate cups at tiny Rossio bars), *Super Bock* or *Sagres* (national lagers; ice-cold from the tap)
- **Azulejos** → tin-glazed ceramic tiles found on facades, stations, kitchens
  - Museu Nacional do Azulejo (Lisbon) for introduction; best facades at São Bento station (Porto) + Estação do Oriente (Lisbon)
- **Safety** → one of the safest countries in Europe; petty theft in Lisbon tourist areas (Alfama, Baixa, trams) + Porto (Ribeira)
