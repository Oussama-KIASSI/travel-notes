- **Percebes** → barnacles scraped off Atlantic rocks; boiled in seawater; eaten by pulling the flesh from the claw; an intense taste of the ocean; surprisingly expensive (the harvesting is dangerous); order them where the kitchen is confident with shellfish
- **Grilled fish** → the Algarve is defined by its fish; the afternoon catch from local boats grilled over wood charcoal; *dourada* (gilt-head bream), *robalo* (sea bass), *cherne* (grouper); the rule is the fewer the ingredients, the better the fish

## Tips — Portugal
- **Language** → Portuguese; English is widely spoken in Lisbon, Porto and tourist areas; less so in rural Alentejo and interior; any Portuguese is warmly appreciated; do not attempt Spanish — Portuguese speakers find it condescending
- **Transport** → Lisbon and Porto have excellent metro systems; for Sintra and Cascais, suburban trains from Lisbon's Cais do Sodré; intercity trains (CP) and Rede Expressos buses connect all major cities; driving in Lisbon is chaotic and parking nearly impossible; the Algarve is best explored by car
- **Tipping** → not obligatory; rounding up or leaving 5–10% at sit-down restaurants is appreciated; not expected at cafés or bars
- **Fado** → the live fado experience is one of Europe's great cultural encounters; in Lisbon, avoid the tourist-facing shows on Rua das Portas de Santo Antão; the authentic venues are in Alfama and Madragoa; in Coimbra, fado is a different style (male voices, academic tradition); the Coimbra style is heard at the university
- **Bacalhau** → salt cod is the cornerstone of Portuguese cuisine; said to have 365 recipes (one for every day of the year); *bacalhau à brás* (shredded with eggs and potato sticks), *bacalhau à Gomes de Sá* (with potatoes, olives and hard-boiled egg), *bacalhau com natas* (with cream) — each region has its version; never tire of it
- **Must-eat** → *pastéis de nata* (custard tarts), *francesinha* (Porto), *cataplana* (Algarve), *bacalhau à brás*, *caldo verde* (kale + sausage soup; the national soup), *ameijoas à bulhão pato* (clams in garlic + coriander), *leitão* (roast suckling pig; best in Bairrada), *tripas à moda do Porto* (Porto's tripe dish; the city's enduring nickname is *tripeiros*)
- **Must-drink** → *vinho verde* (young, slightly fizzy white wine from the Minho; the best summer wine in Europe), *port wine* (drink 10-year or 20-year tawny before dinner as an aperitif; not just for dessert), *Alentejo reds* (full-bodied, earthy; the best table wine in Portugal), *ginjinha* (sour cherry liqueur; drunk from a chocolate cup at tiny bars in Lisbon's Rossio), *Super Bock* or *Sagres* (the national lagers; ice-cold from the tap)
- **Azulejos** → Portuguese tin-glazed ceramic tiles; found on church facades, train stations, kitchen walls and everywhere in between; the Museu Nacional do Azulejo in Lisbon is the essential introduction; some of the best tile facades are on the São Bento train station (Porto) and the Estação do Oriente (Lisbon)
- **Safety** → Portugal is one of the safest countries in Europe; petty theft in tourist areas of Lisbon (Alfama, Baixa, trams) and Porto (Ribeira); keep phones and bags attended; the trams in Lisbon (especially tram 28) are notorious for pickpockets; be vigilant on them
- **Emergency** → 112 (all emergency services)
