- **Midnight Sun** → above Arctic Circle, sun doesn't set Jun 20–Jul 22; bring a sleep mask
  - Blackout curtains standard in Tromsø hotels
- **Polar Night** → Nov–Jan in Tromsø, sun doesn't rise; "blue hour" midday (10 AM–1 PM) gives cold twilight
- **Transport** → Bergen Railway (Oslo–Bergen, 7 hrs) is a top scenic train journey
  - Flamsbana (Myrdal–Flam, 20 km, 50 min): steepest normal-track railway in the world
  - Domestic flights (Norwegian, Widerøe): Oslo–Tromsø 1h50
