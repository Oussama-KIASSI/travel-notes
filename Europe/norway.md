## Tromsø — 2 days

**Attractions**
- **Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis)** → Tromsø at 69°N is one of the best places in the world to see the Northern Lights; the aurora season runs Sep–Mar with Nov–Jan being the most reliable; clear nights away from light pollution are essential; guided chasing tours take you out of the city by bus or snowcat to find clear sky; most tours run 6–8 hrs; the lights can be dramatic (full green curtains dancing across the sky) or subtle — there is no guarantee but the landscape alone makes the trip worthwhile
- **Whale Watching** → Nov–Jan is the peak season for orca (killer whale) and humpback whale watching in the fjords near Tromsø; the orcas follow the herring migration into the narrow fjords and feed in spectacular coordinated bursts; 6-hour boat tours from the harbor; one of the great wildlife experiences in Europe; warm clothing essential (−10°C on the water)
- **Arctic Cathedral (Ishavskatedralen)** → the most striking piece of architecture in northern Norway; the triangular aluminum-clad facade rises like a glacier or a ship's prow; the enormous stained-glass window on the east end is 23 m high; across the bridge from the city center; the organ concerts on summer evenings at midnight (under the Midnight Sun) are unique
- **Polaria Arctic Experience Center** → panoramic cinema with a film on Arctic nature + an aquarium with live Arctic species including bearded seals; the building itself is designed to mimic ice floes stacked by spring ice-break; well-suited for an afternoon when weather is bad
- **Fjellheisen Cable Car** → the gondola from the city to the 421 m summit of Storsteinen; panoramic view over Tromsø island, the surrounding fjords and mountains; in winter the view at night with the Northern Lights overhead is extraordinary; return; open until 11 PM in summer (Midnight Sun), later in winter for aurora watching from above

- **Dog Sledding** → guided dog sled tours through the mountain forests on the mainland outside Tromsø; typically 2–3 hrs; you drive your own sled with instruction; the dogs are Siberian Huskies or Alaskan Huskies bred for the purpose

**Food**
- **Tromsø seafood** → at this latitude, the cold Arctic water produces the finest king crab, fresh cod (*skrei* in winter), *sei* (saithe), and the best langoustines in Norway; any restaurant in the harbor area; **Arctandria** → the best fish restaurant in Tromsø
- **Reindeer** → reindeer stew, reindeer carpaccio and reindeer sausages are on virtually every menu in Tromsø; rich, gamey and deeply flavored; better than venison; try at **Emma's Drømmekjøkken**
- **Mack Ølhallen** → the world's northernmost brewery (founded 1877, Mack Brewery); the pub (*ølhallen*) attached to the brewery is the most historic bar in northern Norway; Mack's Arctic lager is one of the best Norwegian beers; the brewery tours are educational

## Tips — Norway
- **Northern Lights** → not guaranteed on any given night; the KP index (magnetic activity scale) predicts probability but cloud cover is the main enemy; stay flexible if chasing the lights; the free apps *Space Weather* and *Aurora Forecast* are reliable for predictions
- **Midnight Sun** → above the Arctic Circle the sun doesn't set Jun 20–Jul 22; this is disorienting and beautiful; bring a sleep mask and blackout curtains are standard in Tromsø hotels; the light at 2 AM is extraordinary
- **Polar Night** → Nov–Jan in Tromsø the sun doesn't rise; the "blue hour" around midday (10 AM–1 PM) gives a dramatic cold twilight; surprisingly beautiful and not as depressing as expected
- **Costs** → Norway is among the most expensive countries in the world; a simple meal ; a pint of beer ; accommodation budget; budget including all expenses
- **Transport** → the Bergen Railway (Oslo–Bergen; 7 hrs) is one of the world's great train journeys; the Flåmsbana (Myrdal–Flåm; 20 km, 50 min) is the steepest railway in the world on normal track; domestic flights (Norwegian, Widerøe) are efficient for Oslo–Tromsø (1h50); the Hurtigruten coastal ferry covers the entire Norwegian coastline from Bergen to Kirkenes
- **Must-eat** → *brunost* (brown caramelized whey cheese; the most Norwegian food; essential on crisp bread), *gravlaks* (dill-cured salmon), *fårikål* (Norway's national dish: lamb and cabbage stew; served in autumn), *lutefisk* (lye-cured dried fish; polarizing but traditional), king crab legs, *lefse* (soft flatbread), *skillingsbolle* (Bergen's cinnamon bun, more cardamom-forward than a Swedish *kanelbulle*)
- **Must-drink** → *aquavit* (*akevitt*; Norway's national spirit; caraway-flavored; aged in sherry casks; served ice-cold with food), *Ringnes* or *Hansa* lager (the national beers), *Farris* mineral water (Norwegian spring water, the best table water in Scandinavia), cloudberry (*multe*) juice or jam at breakfast
- **Hiking** → *allemannsretten* (the right to roam) gives everyone the right to walk anywhere in Norwegian nature; no private-land restrictions for hiking; campsites can be set up anywhere in nature at least 150 m from a house
- **Safety** → Norway is one of the world's safest countries; petty crime is minimal; the main risks are outdoors (avalanches, fjord-edge falls, sudden weather changes); tell someone your route before hiking in remote areas
- **Emergency** → 110 (fire), 112 (police), 113 (ambulance/medical)
