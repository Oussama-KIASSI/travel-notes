# Brazil

## Overview
Fifth-largest country; most biodiverse nation on Earth. Contains 60% of Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal (world's largest wetland), and the Atlantic Forest. Only Portuguese-speaking country in the Americas (colonized 1500). Independence 1822, republic 1889. Cultural identity shaped by African, Indigenous, European, and Asian influences. Largest economy in Latin America; significant inequality persists.

## Historical Context
Portuguese arrived 1500 (Cabral); indigenous nations decimated by disease + enslavement. Largest destination for enslaved Africans in the Americas (4+ million, primarily from West Africa/Angola). African influence strongest in Bahia + Northeast. Portuguese royal family fled to Rio during Napoleonic Wars (1808); Rio = only European capital outside Europe. Slavery abolished 1888 (last in Americas). Military dictatorship 1964–1985; return to democracy. Lula (2003–2010) lifted millions from poverty. 2014 World Cup + 2016 Olympics marked by inequality protests. 2023–2025: improved democratic stability + renewed environmental protection.
