# Brazil

## Overview
Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country and the most biodiverse nation on Earth. Home to 60% of the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal (world's largest wetland), and the Atlantic Forest, Brazil contains more species than any other country. The nation was colonized by Portugal in 1500, making it the only Portuguese-speaking country in the Americas. Brazil gained independence in 1822 and became a republic in 1889. The country's cultural identity is defined by miscegenation—African, Indigenous, European, and Asian influences have created unique regional cultures. Carnival, football, bossa nova, and samba are global exports. Brazil's economy is the largest in Latin America, though inequality remains significant.

## Historical Context
The Portuguese arrived in 1500 (Pedro Álvares Cabral); indigenous Tupi, Guaraní, and hundreds of other nations were decimated by disease and enslavement. Brazil became the largest destination for enslaved Africans in the Americas (4+ million people, primarily from West Africa and Angola). The African influence is strongest in Bahia and the Northeast. The Portuguese royal family fled to Rio during the Napoleonic Wars (1808), making Rio the only European capital outside Europe. Brazil abolished slavery in 1888 (the last in the Americas). The 20th century saw rapid industrialization, military dictatorship (1964–1985), and return to democracy. Lula da Silva's presidency (2003–2010) lifted millions from poverty. The 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics in Rio were marked by protests over inequality. Political polarization intensified in 2018–2022. The 2023–2025 period saw improved democratic stability and renewed environmental protection efforts.

## Safety & Political Updates (2020–2025)
**COVID-19 Impact**: Brazil was severely affected (2020–2022) with over 700,000 deaths. Tourism infrastructure fully recovered by 2023. Vaccination required for entry (check current requirements).

**Political Situation**: Lula returned to presidency in 2023 after defeating Bolsonaro in 2022 elections. Stability improved; democratic institutions strengthened. Amazon deforestation rates dropped significantly in 2023–2024.

**Safety for Travelers**: Petty crime (pickpocketing, phone theft) remains common in Rio, São Paulo, and Recife—especially tourist areas and beaches. Violent crime decreased in Rio (2019–2024) with improved policing. Use ride-sharing apps (Uber, 99) exclusively at night. Avoid favelas without reputable guides. Beach crime peaks Dec–Feb (summer vacation). Copa-Leme beaches in Rio safer than Ipanema at night. Don't wear jewelry or display cameras/phones openly. ATM skimming occurs—use bank-branch ATMs only. Scams targeting tourists common in Rio Centro and Lapa. Women travelers report Rio and Salvador as safe with standard precautions. LGBT+ travelers: São Paulo Pride is the world's largest; Brazil generally welcoming though attitudes vary regionally.
