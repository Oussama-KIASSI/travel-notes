# Cuba

## Best Time to Visit
- **Nov–Apr** → dry season; 22–28°C; the best window; clear skies, manageable heat; peak tourist season (Europeans escaping winter)
- **May–Oct** → rainy season; humid + hot (30°C+); hurricane risk Jun–Oct (Cuba was severely hit by Hurricane Ian in Sept 2022 and Hurricane Idalia in 2023; infrastructure recovery ongoing); fewer tourists; lower prices at paladares
- Havana + western Cuba → year-round; summer is very hot + wet but manageable if you embrace the rhythm of afternoon siestas
- Avoid major holidays (Jul 26 = Revolution Day, May 1 = Labor Day) unless you want to see the state-organized parades; New Year's Eve is the anniversary of the 1959 Revolution and a major national celebration

## Havana — 2–3 days

**Attractions**
- **Habana Vieja** (UNESCO) → the old city; 500 years of Spanish colonial architecture in various states of restoration and decay; founded in 1519; the restoration project (begun in 1993 by City Historian Eusebio Leal, who passed away in 2020) has transformed key plazas but much remains beautifully ruined; walk every street; Plaza de Armas (original city center; book market daily), Plaza Vieja (fully restored; most photogenic), Plaza de la Catedral (18th-c Baroque cathedral dominates the intimate square), Plaza de San Francisco (working port area; cruise ship terminal); the contrast between restored zones and crumbling tenements is the essence of contemporary Havana
- **Malecón** → the 8 km seafront boulevard; built 1901–1952; the living room of Havana; locals gather at dusk to socialize, fish, drink rum, play music; walk the full length at sunset; waves crash over the seawall during winter storms; the buildings along the Malecón are slowly collapsing from salt erosion and neglect — among the most photographed ruins in the world
- **Capitolio** → the restored national capitol building (reopened 2019 after years of restoration); modeled on Washington D.C. but slightly taller; built 1926–1929 during the wealthy pre-revolution period; stunning interior with 24-carat gold leaf dome; guided tours available; housed the Cuban Congress until 1959; now home to the Cuban Academy of Sciences
- **El Gran Teatro de La Habana** → neo-baroque theater on Central Park; one of the most beautiful buildings in the Caribbean; built 1915; home of the Cuban National Ballet (founded by prima ballerina assoluta Alicia Alonso in 1948); catch a ballet or performance if possible; tickets are absurdly cheap (€5–15) for world-class performances
- **Museo de la Revolución** → housed in the former presidential palace (1920); fascinating + heavily biased account of Cuban history told entirely from the revolutionary perspective; Che Guevara's beret + jacket on display; the "Corner of Cretins" caricatures Reagan, Bush Sr.; essential context for understanding how the state tells its own story; the Granma yacht (which brought Fidel, Che and 80 others from Mexico in 1956) is preserved in a glass case outside
- **Fusterlandia** → José Fuster's neighborhood in Jaimanitas (20 km west of Havana); an entire district covered in Gaudí-esque mosaic murals since the 1990s; Fuster has transformed over 80 homes, bus stops, benches, and doctor's offices into a public artwork with the support of neighbors; one of the most extraordinary outsider art environments in the world; the artist is often on-site and welcoming; free but donations appreciated
- **Callejón de Hamel** → Afro-Cuban culture alley in Centro Habana; murals by Salvador González Escalona celebrating Santería and Afro-Cuban religions; rumba performances on Sunday afternoons at noon (the only guaranteed free rumba in Havana; arrives early); has become heavily touristy but the music is authentic
- **Parque Almendares + Bosque de La Habana** → the city's green lung; rare tropical forest along the Almendares river; escape the heat; popular with Cuban families on weekends
- **Necrópolis Cristóbal Colón** → one of the most elaborate cemeteries in the world; 57 hectares; 800,000+ burials; extraordinary funerary sculpture in marble and granite; Cuban independence heroes, chess champion José Raúl Capablanca, and Alicia Alonso are buried here; the tomb of Amelia Goyri ("La Milagrosa") is the most visited — a woman who died in childbirth in 1901 and became the subject of miracle stories
- **Pilar** → Hemingway's fishing boat, preserved at the Museo Ernest Hemingway in Finca Vigía (15 km southeast of Havana); Hemingway lived in this house 1939–1960 (he left Cuba in 1960 and died in 1961); the house remains exactly as he left it (books, hunting trophies, typewriter visible through windows); the boat where he fished for marlin and hunted German U-boats during WWII is in the garden; entry €5
- **Playas del Este** → the closest Caribbean beaches to Havana (20 km east); where Habaneros go on weekends; less pristine than the keys but authentic; avoid the overpriced tourist beach sections

**Food**
- **Paladares** → always eat at paladares (private restaurants) over state restaurants; quality is incomparably better; paladares were legalized in 1995 (initially limited to 12 seats in family homes); restrictions loosened significantly 2011–2021 allowing them to compete with state restaurants; many of the best have emerged since 2015; the paladar boom represents the most visible element of Cuba's private sector experiment
  - **La Guarida** → the most famous paladar in Cuba; in a crumbling Havana mansion (the building was featured in the 1994 film Fresa y Chocolate); three flights of decaying marble stairs to a beautifully appointed dining room; stunning setting; try the *ropa vieja* + fresh seafood; book days ahead; expensive by Cuban standards (€30–40/person)
  - **El del Frente** → rooftop paladar with Havana views; creative cocktails + Cuban food; one of the new generation of design-conscious restaurants; excellent cocktail program
  - **Doña Eutimia** → tiny, legendary; best *ropa vieja* + *picadillo* in the city; 8 tables in a colonial courtyard off Plaza de la Catedral; queue expected; no reservations; arrive before opening at noon
  - **San Cristóbal** → Obama dined here in 2016 during his historic visit; upscale paladar; Cuban classics done very well; walls covered in Santería imagery and revolutionary memorabilia
- **Street food** → *croquetas* (ham croquettes; fried and sold from street carts for 5–10 CUP each), *pan con lechón* (roast pork sandwich), *tostones* (fried plantain), fresh fruit from street vendors; pizza sold by the slice (Cuban pizza is mediocre by global standards but beloved locally)
- **El Floridita** → Hemingway's daiquiri bar (he claimed to have drunk 16 in one sitting); touristy but historic; the original frozen daiquiri was invented here in the 1930s; go once for the history; a daiquiri is €8; life-size bronze statue of Hemingway at his usual spot at the end of the bar
- **La Bodeguita del Medio** → Hemingway's mojito bar; "My mojito in La Bodeguita, my daiquiri in El Floridita" — though this quote's authenticity is disputed; packed + overpriced but iconic; worth seeing for the graffiti-covered walls (everyone from Fidel to Nat King Cole has signed); the mojitos are good but you'll pay tourist prices (€6–8)

**Nightlife**
- **Casa de la Música (Miramar)** → the best live Cuban music venue in the city; state-run but high quality; salsa, son, timba performed by Cuba's top bands; the real thing; two shows nightly (afternoon matinee 5 PM, evening show 10 PM); entry €10–20; the outdoor courtyard fills with dancers — locals and tourists alike; dress code enforced (no shorts/flip-flops after 8 PM)
- **Casa de la Música (Centro Habana)** → smaller, more local version on the Galiano pedestrian street; afternoon matinées are excellent value (€3–5 entry); less touristy than the Miramar location
- **La Zorra y el Cuervo** → underground jazz club on La Rampa in Vedado; literally underground — descend the stairs beneath a red British phone box; live jazz every night from 10 PM; Cuba produces world-class jazz musicians trained at the Instituto Superior de Arte; one of the best jazz clubs in Latin America; entry €10; tiny capacity; arrive early
- **Fabrica de Arte Cubano (FAC)** → converted cooking oil factory in Vedado; the most creative cultural space in Cuba; opened 2014 by Cuban artist X Alfonso; art galleries, multiple live stages, DJs, cinema, bars all under one roof; Thu–Sun nights 8 PM–3 AM; entry €2; showcases Cuba's contemporary art and experimental music scene; young, creative crowd; the antithesis of state-controlled culture; unmissable; has survived periodic government pressure and temporary closures
- **El Sauce** → local Cuban music + dancing in Vedado; open-air venue; far fewer tourists; the real Havana nightlife experience; timba (fast, aggressive Cuban salsa fusion) dominates; Cubans dance at a level that intimidates most foreigners but the atmosphere is warm
- **Tropicana** → legendary outdoor cabaret since 1939; the only pre-revolution nightclub still operating in its original form; 200 performers in elaborate feathered costumes under the stars; spectacular but expensive (€75–95 including transport + show + drink); worth it for the spectacle at least once; kitsch and genuinely impressive in equal measure

## Viñales — 1–2 days

**Attractions**
- **Tobacco valley** → the most beautiful valley in Cuba; towering *mogotes* (limestone karst hills) rising from perfectly flat red-soil farmland; cycle or horse-ride through it
- **Tobacco farm visits** → watch farmers hand-roll cigars from leaf; buy directly from the farmer (far better quality + price than state shops)
- **Cave tours** → **Cueva del Indio** (boat ride through a river cave; pre-Columbian Taíno paintings on the walls); **Gran Caverna de Santo Tomás** (Cuba's largest cave system)
- **Mogotes hiking** → trails through the valley and up into the limestone hills; hire a local guide
- **Palenque de los Cimarrones** → former runaway slave settlement in a cave; now a cultural center with live Afro-Cuban music + dance

**Food**
- **Casa de Don Tomás** → oldest restaurant in Viñales; colonial house; *delicias de Don Tomás* (mixed meat platter) is the signature
- **Balcón del Valle** → best view in Viñales; terrace restaurant overlooking the mogotes; eat at dusk

---

## Cienfuegos + Trinidad — 2 days

**Attractions**
- **Cienfuegos**
  - **Parque José Martí** → the finest main square in Cuba; UNESCO; surrounded by neoclassical buildings including the Teatro Tomás Terry
  - **Punta Gorda promenade** → walk the peninsula past pastel-painted Art Deco villas; the most elegant neighborhood in Cuba
  - **Palacio de Valle** → extraordinary Moorish-Gothic-Baroque mansion; now a restaurant; visit for the architecture
- **Trinidad** (UNESCO) → the best-preserved colonial city in the Caribbean; cobblestone streets, pastel houses, horse-drawn carts; feels genuinely frozen in time
  - **Plaza Mayor** → the central square; surrounded by museums, churches + palaces; the most photogenic spot in Cuba
  - **Museo Nacional de Lucha contra Bandidos** → in a former convent bell tower; climb the tower for the best view over Trinidad's red-tiled rooftops
  - **Playa Ancón** → Cuba's best beach within easy reach of a colonial city; 12 km from Trinidad; turquoise water + white sand
  - **Valle de los Ingenios** → UNESCO; valley of former sugar mills; plantation ruins + watchtowers visible from the road

**Food**
- Eat exclusively at paladares in both cities; quality far above state options
- **Trinidad** → try *canchánchara* (the original Cuban cocktail: aguardiente, honey, lemon, water) at the Casa de la Canchánchara on Plaza Mayor

**Nightlife**
- **Trinidad**
  - **La Casa de la Música** → open-air steps of the old church converted into a nightly music stage; locals + travelers dance together; one of the great free nightlife experiences in Cuba
  - **Disco Ayala** → nightclub inside a natural cave; one of the most unique clubs in the world; live music then DJ sets

---

## Santa Clara — half day (en route)

**Attractions**
- **Complejo Escultórico Ernesto Che Guevara** → the massive bronze statue + mausoleum containing Che's remains; free entry; moving and significant regardless of politics
- **Tren Blindado monument** → the overturned armored train that Che's forces derailed in 1958; decisive moment in the revolution; the original train cars still on site

---

## Varadero + Jardines del Rey — 1–2 days

**Attractions**
- **Varadero beach** → 20 km of unbroken white sand; the classic Cuban beach resort; excellent for a simple beach day after days of city-hopping
- **Cayo Coco + Cayo Guillermo** → remote causeway-accessed keys; extraordinary birdlife (flamingos); some of Cuba's clearest water + best diving/snorkeling; more effort to reach but more beautiful than Varadero

## Tips — Cuba
- **Visa** → tourist card (tarjeta del turista) required for most nationalities; valid 30 days (extendable once for another 30 days); bought through airline (at check-in or on board) or Cuban embassy; €15–25; US citizens face additional restrictions (must travel under one of 12 approved categories; general tourism is not permitted under US law; many US visitors travel via "Support for the Cuban People" category)
- **Cash** → bring cash; US credit/debit cards do not work due to the embargo; European, Canadian, and other non-US cards theoretically work but are unreliable; assume you're cash-only; euros, Canadian dollars + British pounds are easiest to exchange; change money at Cadecas (official exchange houses) or banks, not on the street; commission charged (3% typically); never exchange US dollars (10% penalty + commission applies due to US embargo)
- **Currency reform** → Cuba unified its dual currency system in Jan 2021, eliminating the CUC (tourist peso) and making the CUP (Cuban peso) the only legal tender; exchange rate is now floating (was fixed for decades); as of 2024, official rate is ~120 CUP = €1, but informal/street rate can be 150+ CUP = €1; many tourist services now quote prices in USD or EUR to avoid CUP volatility; always confirm currency and final price before ordering; the currency situation remains unstable and confusing
- **Shortages** → ongoing severe shortages of fuel, food, medicine + basic goods due to economic crisis (2020–2024); worst shortages since the "Special Period" of the 1990s; causes: US embargo, loss of Venezuelan oil subsidies, COVID-19 tourism collapse, government mismanagement; blackouts are common (power grid failure in 2023 left the entire island without electricity for days); accept that plans may change; bus + taxi availability can be unreliable; build in flexibility; bring any medications you need; rationing of basic goods for Cubans continues; tourists are largely insulated but will notice empty shops and limited restaurant menus
- **Internet** → very limited and expensive by global standards; state telecom ETECSA controls all internet; buy a NAUTA card (€1/hour) to access WiFi in public hotspots (parks, hotels); mobile data available via NAUTA Hogar (purchase SIM card + data packages); do not rely on internet access for navigation; download offline maps before arrival; WhatsApp works; Instagram/Facebook are accessible but slow; many Cubans use VPNs; the government censors some sites
- **Recent protests** → July 11, 2021 saw the largest anti-government protests since the Revolution; thousands marched in Havana and other cities shouting "libertad" (freedom) and "patria y vida" (homeland and life, a rebuttal to the revolutionary slogan "patria o muerte"); hundreds were arrested; long prison sentences handed down; the protests reflected deep frustration with economic collapse, shortages, and lack of political freedom; travel during your visit is safe but the underlying tensions remain
- **Must-drink** → mojito (white rum, lime, sugar, mint, soda), daiquiri (white rum, lime, sugar, ice — the Hemingway version adds grapefruit and maraschino), *Cuba libre* (rum and Coke with lime; ironic name given the political situation), *canchánchara* (aguardiente, honey, lime), ron añejo (aged rum) — Havana Club 7 años is the benchmark; also try Santiago de Cuba and Legendario brands; a bottle of Havana Club 7 costs €6–8 in Cuba vs €25+ abroad
- **Must-eat** → *ropa vieja* (shredded beef in tomato sauce; literally "old clothes"; one of Cuba's most iconic dishes), *moros y cristianos* (black beans + white rice; the name means "Moors and Christians"), *lechón asado* (slow-roasted pork; the centerpiece of celebrations), *tostones* (fried plantain), *yuca con mojo* (cassava with garlic sauce), fresh lobster (absurdly cheap + excellent at paladares; €10–15 for a whole grilled lobster; export is illegal so it's all consumed domestically), *flan* (the national dessert; Cuban flan is exceptionally dense and sweet)
- **Cigars** → Cuba produces the world's finest hand-rolled cigars; brands include Cohiba, Montecristo, Romeo y Julieta, Partagás; buy from farmers in Viñales (where you can watch them being rolled) or from certified Casa del Habano shops (state-run; guaranteed authentic); avoid street sellers (fakes — often filled with banana leaves or floor sweepings); a box of 25 mid-range cigars costs €100–200; export limit is 50 cigars without receipt, unlimited with official receipt; the US import ban means Americans should not attempt to bring them home
- **Classic cars** → the iconic 1950s American cars (Chevys, Fords, Buicks) are everywhere due to the 1960 US embargo freezing car imports; estimated 60,000 pre-revolution American cars still running; maintained through ingenuity (engines often swapped with Soviet Ladas or modern diesel); classic car taxis offer tours (negotiate price; €25–40/hour typical); the cars are beautiful but most lack functioning seatbelts, brakes are questionable, and exhaust fumes are toxic — romantic but unsafe by modern standards
- **Safety** → Cuba is very safe for tourists; violent crime against foreigners is rare; petty theft and scams exist (particularly taxi overcharging, fake cigars, jineteros/jineteras approaching tourists with "opportunities"); police presence is heavy; Cuban police prioritize tourist safety (tourists bring hard currency); normal urban awareness applies
- **Emergency** → ambulance 104, fire 105, police 106; medical care is free for Cubans; foreigners must pay; Cuba has well-trained doctors but limited equipment/medicines due to shortages; serious medical issues require evacuation to Mexico or USA; travel insurance with medical evacuation coverage is essential
