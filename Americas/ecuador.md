# Ecuador

## Historical Context
**Pre-Columbian Era**: Ecuador's territory hosted multiple advanced cultures before the Incas: the Valdivia (3500 BCE, one of the Americas' earliest pottery cultures), Quitu-Cara (Quito valley), Cañari (highlands), and coastal kingdoms. The Inca conquest of Ecuador (1463-1525) was brutal and incomplete; Emperor Huayna Capac was born in Tomebamba (modern Cuenca). His death from European diseases triggered a civil war between his sons Atahualpa (born in Quito, controlled northern empire) and Huáscar (Cusco-based), weakening the empire just before Spanish arrival.

**Colonial Period**: Spanish conquistador Sebastián de Benalcázar founded Quito in 1534 atop Inca ruins. Quito became a major colonial administrative center (Real Audiencia de Quito) and artistic hub, producing the distinctive "Quito School" of religious art (blend of Spanish baroque with indigenous themes). The Jesuit Reducciones controlled vast territories. Indigenous peoples were enslaved under the *encomienda* system and forced into textile workshops (*obrajes*). African slaves were brought to coastal plantations.

**Independence & Republic**: Ecuador gained independence in 1822, initially as part of Gran Colombia (with Colombia, Venezuela, Panama) under Simón Bolívar. It became fully independent in 1830. The 19th-20th centuries saw extreme political instability, with liberal-conservative conflicts, military coups, and regional rivalries (coastal Guayaquil vs. highland Quito). Ecuador lost territory to all neighbors: Amazon regions to Brazil (1904), jungle provinces to Peru (wars in 1941, 1981, 1995, finally resolved 1998).

**Modern Era (2000-2024)**: Ecuador dollarized in 2000 after economic collapse, eliminating the sucre currency. Rafael Correa's presidency (2007-2017) brought political stability, infrastructure investment, and social programs funded by oil revenues, but also authoritarianism and debt accumulation (especially to China). Post-Correa instability saw three presidents in four years (2017-2021). Guillermo Lasso (conservative banker, elected 2021) dissolved congress in 2023 amid impeachment proceedings. Daniel Noboa (35, son of banana magnate) won snap elections in 2023, becoming Ecuador's youngest president.

**Security Crisis (2020-2024)**: Ecuador experienced dramatic deterioration in security due to drug trafficking cartels using the country as a transit hub. Homicide rates increased 5x (2018-2023). Coastal cities (Guayaquil, Esmeraldas, Manta) saw gang violence, prison riots with hundreds dead, and attacks on police/journalists. Tourist areas (Quito, Cuenca, Baños, Galápagos) remain relatively safe, but travelers should exercise caution. States of emergency declared multiple times (2021-2024). Government deployed military to restore order.

**Indigenous Movements**: Ecuador has strong indigenous political organization (CONAIE - Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities). The 1990 Indigenous Uprising shut down the country for weeks. Indigenous groups successfully blocked oil extraction in some Amazon territories. The 2019 and 2022 strikes paralyzed Ecuador for weeks, protesting fuel prices and economic policies. Ecuador's constitution (2008) was the first to recognize "rights of nature" (Pachamama).

**Geography**: Ecuador is named for the equator running through it. Compact size (283,000 km²) contains incredible geographic diversity: Pacific coast, Andes highlands (two parallel mountain ranges with volcanoes), Amazon rainforest, and Galápagos Islands. Contains the world's highest active volcano (Cotopaxi, 5,897 m) and point closest to sun/farthest from Earth's center (Chimborazo summit due to equatorial bulge).
