# Ecuador

## Historical Context
**Pre-Columbian Era**: Multiple advanced cultures preceded the Incas: Valdivia (3500 BCE, earliest Americas pottery), Quitu-Cara, Cañari, and coastal kingdoms. Inca conquest (1463–1525) was brutal and incomplete. Emperor Huayna Capac born in Tomebamba (modern Cuenca); his death triggered civil war between sons Atahualpa and Huáscar, weakening the empire before Spanish arrival.

**Colonial Period**: Benalcázar founded Quito 1534 atop Inca ruins. Became major colonial center (Real Audiencia de Quito). "Quito School" of religious art blended Spanish baroque with indigenous themes. Indigenous enslaved under *encomienda* system and textile workshops (*obrajes*).

**Independence & Republic**: Independence 1822, initially part of Gran Colombia under Bolívar. Fully independent 1830. Extreme political instability; lost territory to all neighbors including Amazon regions to Brazil (1904) and jungle provinces to Peru (wars in 1941, 1981, 1995; resolved 1998).

**Modern Era (2000-2024)**: Dollarized in 2000 after economic collapse. Correa presidency (2007-2017) brought stability but also authoritarianism and debt (especially to China). Post-Correa instability: three presidents in four years (2017-2021). Daniel Noboa won 2023 snap elections, becoming youngest president at 35.

**Security Crisis (2020-2024)**: Drug trafficking cartels caused 5x homicide rate increase (2018-2023). Coastal cities (Guayaquil, Esmeraldas) saw gang violence and prison riots. Tourist areas (Quito, Cuenca, Baños, Galapagos) remain relatively safe. Multiple states of emergency declared.

**Indigenous Movements**: Strong political organization (CONAIE). 1990 Indigenous Uprising shut down the country. 2019 and 2022 strikes paralyzed Ecuador for weeks. Constitution (2008) first to recognize "rights of nature."

**Geography**: Named for the equator. 283,000 km² with Pacific coast, Andes highlands, Amazon rainforest, and Galapagos. Contains Cotopaxi (5,897 m, highest active volcano) and Chimborazo (farthest point from Earth's center due to equatorial bulge).

## Best Time to Visit
**Highlands** (Quito, Cotopaxi, Baños)
- Dry season Jun–Sep → clearest skies, best volcano views
- Rainy Oct–Nov & Feb–May → afternoon showers only, still manageable

**Coast** (Guayaquil, Montañita)
- Dec–Apr → warm, sunny, wettest (25–32°C)
- May–Nov → dry season, cooler, overcast, calmer seas → best for surf
