# Venezuela

## Overview
Home to the world's highest waterfall (Angel Falls), largest oil reserves, and pristine wilderness. Spans Caribbean coast, Andean peaks, vast llanos (plains), and ancient Guiana Highlands tepui formations (table-top mountains billions of years old). Severe economic crisis since 2013: hyperinflation, political instability, 7+ million emigrants. Tourism infrastructure limited but natural wonders remain spectacular. Requires careful planning and realistic expectations.

## Historical Context
Indigenous peoples included Carib, Arawak, and Timoto-Cuica. Columbus reached Venezuela 1498; name means "Little Venice" (from indigenous stilt houses over Lake Maracaibo). Birthplace of Simón Bolívar (1783, Caracas), liberator of six nations. Independence 1821. Oil discovery (1914) transformed Venezuela into Latin America's richest nation by 1950s. Hugo Chávez's "Bolivarian Revolution" (1999–2013) nationalized industries; reduced poverty initially but left economy oil-dependent. After Chávez's death (2013), Maduro's presidency coincided with oil price collapse. 2015–2023: hyperinflation (1,000,000% at peak), economic collapse, food/medicine shortages, 7+ million emigrated. 2020–2024: partial stabilization via dollarization; inflation decreased but remains high; political situation tense with disputed elections.

## Safety & Political Updates (2020–2025)
**Political Situation (Critical)**: Maduro remains president despite disputed elections. Economy partially dollarized with some stabilization. Services unreliable. Avoid demonstrations.

**Economic Reality**: Hyperinflation period ended but prices volatile. USD widely used. Bring all cash needed — ATMs unreliable, credit cards rarely work. Fuel shortages intermittent. Power outages common outside tourist zones. Internet poor.

**Safety for Travelers**:
- **Caracas**: High crime; avoid or airport transit only with pre-arranged transfer
- **Tourist areas (Los Roques, Canaima, Mérida)**: Relatively safer within organized tours
- **General**: Travel only with reputable tour companies; all Angel Falls/Canaima visits require guided tours (mandatory)
  - Bring all supplies (medicines, toiletries, snacks); shortages affect availability
  - Petty + violent crime risk in cities; register with embassy
- **Border regions**: Avoid Colombian border (armed groups) and Brazil border (Roraima, unstable)

**Entry**: Check visa requirements (change frequently); tourist card usually on arrival; confirm procedures with operators before booking.

**COVID-19**: Restrictions lifted 2023; healthcare system strained.
