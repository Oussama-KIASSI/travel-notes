# Panama

## Overview
Panama's identity is defined by the Canal—the engineering marvel that connects two oceans and transformed global trade. This narrow Central American nation (S-shaped; 80 km wide at narrowest) bridges North and South America, creating unique biodiversity as species from both continents meet. Panama City is Latin America's most modern capital, with Manhattan-like skyline contrasting with Casco Viejo's colonial charm. Beyond the urban center, Panama offers pristine Caribbean islands (San Blas, Bocas del Toro), cloud forest highlands (Boquete), indigenous territories (Guna, Emberá, Ngäbe-Buglé), and the impenetrable Darién Gap—where the Pan-American Highway ends and South America begins. Panama is wealthy by regional standards (banking hub, Canal revenues), politically stable, and increasingly tourist-friendly. The US dollar is official currency. Spanish, indigenous languages, and English (Caribbean coast) reflect diverse heritage. "The Bridge of the World, Heart of the Universe" is the national motto.

## Historical Context
Pre-Columbian Panama was crossroads for indigenous trade; cultures included Chibchan peoples. Balboa crossed the isthmus and "discovered" the Pacific (1513)—first European to see Eastern Pacific. Spain used Panama route (Camino Real) to ship Peruvian silver to Atlantic; Portobelo became richest port in Americas; pirate attacks frequent (Henry Morgan sacked Panama City 1671). Independence from Spain came 1821 (joined Gran Colombia). Panama attempted to separate from Colombia multiple times. The California Gold Rush (1848) made Panama crossing valuable; US-built transisthmian railroad (1850s). French attempt to build canal (1880s) failed catastrophically (22,000 workers died; de Lesseps company bankrupted). US supported Panamanian independence from Colombia (1903) in exchange for Canal Zone control; Panama became independent November 3, 1903. US built Canal (1904–1914); 40,000+ workers (many Caribbean); opened August 15, 1914. Canal Zone was US territory (creating "country within country"); political tensions persisted. 1964 Flag Riots killed 22 Panamanians; began sovereignty negotiations. Torrijos-Carter Treaties (1977) transferred Canal to Panama (completed December 31, 1999). Manuel Noriega dictatorship (1983–1989) ended with US invasion (Operation Just Cause). Democracy restored; economic growth followed. 2016 Canal expansion opened New Panamax locks (allowing larger ships). 2020s: Panama prospered as logistics/banking hub; democratic institutions stable.

## Safety & Political Updates (2020–2025)
**Political Situation**: Stable democracy; President José Raúl Mulino elected 2024. Peaceful transitions of power. No significant political violence. Democratic institutions function well. Some corruption issues but overall governance stable.

**COVID-19 Impact**: Strict lockdowns 2020–2021 (curfews, restrictions). Tourism recovered 2022–2023. No entry restrictions remain as of 2024.

**Safety for Travelers**: Panama is relatively safe. Panama City: Casco Viejo and tourist zones safe with police presence; avoid El Chorrillo, Calidonia, and peripheral neighborhoods (especially at night). Petty crime (pickpocketing, bag snatching) occurs in crowded areas. Colón city (Atlantic side) has high crime—most travelers avoid or transit quickly. Tourist areas (Bocas del Toro, Boquete, Casco Viejo, Canal Zone) are safe. San Blas/Guna Yala is very safe (Guna self-govern; tight control). Darién Gap remains dangerous due to drug trafficking, armed groups, and difficult terrain—only for serious expeditions with proper permits and guides. Rental car break-ins occur at beaches/trailheads. Women travelers report feeling safe with standard urban precautions. LGBT+ travelers: No legal same-sex marriage but generally tolerant; Panama City Pride events; gay-friendly zones in capital.
