# Panama

## Overview
Panama's identity is defined by the Canal — 80 km connecting two oceans. S-shaped nation bridging North and South America; unique biodiversity where species from both continents meet. Panama City has Manhattan-like skyline contrasting with Casco Viejo's colonial charm. Beyond the capital: pristine Caribbean islands (San Blas, Bocas del Toro), cloud forest highlands (Boquete), indigenous territories (Guna, Emberá, Ngäbe-Buglé), and the impenetrable Darién Gap. Wealthy by regional standards (banking hub, Canal revenues), politically stable, USD is official currency.

## Historical Context
Pre-Columbian crossroads for indigenous trade (Chibchan peoples). Balboa crossed the isthmus and reached the Pacific (1513). Spain used Panama to ship Peruvian silver; Portobelo became richest port in Americas; pirate Henry Morgan sacked Panama City 1671. Independence from Spain 1821 (joined Gran Colombia). French canal attempt (1880s) failed catastrophically (22,000 workers died). US supported Panamanian independence from Colombia (1903) in exchange for Canal Zone. Canal built 1904–1914 (40,000+ workers); opened Aug 15, 1914. Canal Zone was US territory; 1964 Flag Riots killed 22 Panamanians. Torrijos-Carter Treaties (1977) transferred Canal to Panama (completed Dec 31, 1999). Noriega dictatorship ended by US invasion 1989. 2016 Canal expansion opened New Panamax locks. Democracy stable since.
