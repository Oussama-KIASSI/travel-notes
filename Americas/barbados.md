# Barbados

## Best Time to Visit
- **Dec–Apr (dry season)** → the best window; 26–30°C; low humidity; northeast trade winds keep it comfortable; peak tourist season (and prices); the main Crop Over festival runs Jul–Aug if culture is a priority
- **May–Jun + Nov** → shoulder season; fewer tourists; lower prices; warm and sunny with brief afternoon showers; the best value window
- **Jul–Oct (rainy season)** → hurricane season; risk is lower in Barbados than in much of the Caribbean (the island is southeast of the main hurricane belt and has been largely spared historically); humidity higher; afternoon showers daily; Crop Over Festival is in Jul–Aug — the most vibrant cultural period of the year
- **Water temperature** → 26–29°C year-round; excellent visibility for diving (20–40 m on the west coast); east coast has stronger Atlantic swell year-round
- **2021 transition** → Barbados became a republic on November 30, 2021 (Independence Day anniversary), removing Queen Elizabeth II as head of state after 396 years of British connection; Dame Sandra Mason became the first President; the transition was peaceful and ceremonial; the island remains in the Commonwealth; culturally significant milestone in post-colonial identity

## Bridgetown + Around — 1–2 days

**Attractions**

- **Garrison Historic Area** (UNESCO) → the best-preserved British military garrison in the Caribbean; over 70 historic structures from the 17th–19th c; the George Washington House (the only place outside the USA where Washington stayed overnight — he visited in 1751 at age 19 with his tubercular half-brother Lawrence; George contracted smallpox during the visit which gave him lifetime immunity during the Revolutionary War), the Barbados Museum (in the former military prison; the best museum in the eastern Caribbean; excellent permanent exhibitions on Amerindian settlements, the sugar economy and slavery; ~€8), the Savannah racecourse (the oldest turf club in the Caribbean, racing since 1845), and the garrison itself; the 19th-c barracks and guardhouses are still in active use by the Barbados Defence Force

- **Gun Hill Signal Station** → one of the five 19th-c British signal stations on hilltops across Barbados; used to relay messages from the garrison to the coast; the view from Gun Hill over the Scotland District, the east coast and the Atlantic is one of the best panoramas on the island; free; the white lion carved from a single piece of coral rock by a British officer in 1868 stands at the base

- **Andromeda Botanic Gardens** → 6 acres of rare palms, tropical shrubs and specimen trees on the rugged east coast; created by amateur horticulturist Iris Bannochie in 1954; the dramatic Atlantic coastline setting with crashing waves in the background makes it more dramatic than Hunte's but less intimate; ~€10; excellent for photographers

## Crop Over Festival (July–August)

- **The most important cultural event in Barbados** → the celebration of the end of the sugar cane harvest; historical roots go back to the 1780s when enslaved workers marked the harvest end with music and dance; banned for decades, revived in 1974 as a national cultural festival; a weeks-long festival culminating in Grand Kadooment (a costumed street parade on the first Monday in August); the island transforms entirely; bands, fêtes, calypso competitions and road march music everywhere; the most authentic Caribbean carnival experience outside Trinidad; superstar Rihanna (Barbados's most famous cultural export, declared National Hero in 2021) regularly participates when in the country; accommodation books out 6–12 months ahead; the masquerade bands design their own costumes (all inclusive, bought months ahead, €100–250)

## Tips — Barbados
- **Currency** → Barbados Dollar (BBD); fixed at 2:1 to the US Dollar (so US$1 = BBD$2 always); US dollars are accepted almost everywhere; credit cards work at all but the most local establishments; ATMs widely available
- **Language** → English (official) + Bajan Creole (the everyday dialect; a heavily African-inflected English with distinct vocabulary and rhythm); understanding Bajan takes a day; speaking back in a Bajan accent is appreciated; literacy rate is 99.6% (one of the highest in the developing world); Barbados has maintained a strong British-influenced education system since independence in 1966
- **Flying fish** → the national symbol of Barbados and its most important fish; appears on coins and the passport; the flying fish (*Hirundichthys affinis*) migrates through Barbadian waters Dec–Jun; outside this season it's frozen; *cutter* (flying fish sandwich in a salt bread roll) is the national street food; buy from any rum shop; ~€3; the flying fish population has declined since 2010 due to changing ocean temperatures and currents (likely climate-related); conservation efforts underway
- **Rum shops** → the social backbone of Barbadian life; estimated 1,500+ rum shops across the island (roughly one for every 200 people); a rum shop is a small neighborhood bar selling Banks beer, rum and sometimes basic food; painted in bright colors; the opposite of tourist infrastructure; the best place to meet Barbadians; rum punch with fresh lime, sugar and angostura bitters is served everywhere; dominoes and heated political debates are constants
- **Driving** → left-hand side (British); the roads are narrow and poorly signposted; the bus system (yellow ZR minibuses and blue government buses) is excellent and runs everywhere for ~€1; renting a car is worthwhile for the east coast and interior; international driving permit officially required but rarely checked; local drivers can be aggressive
- **Must-eat** → *cou-cou and flying fish* (the national dish — cornmeal and okra with fried flying fish; West African origins in the cornmeal-okra combination), *fish cutter* (flying fish sandwich), *macaroni pie* (baked mac and cheese; the island staple at every cookout), *pepperpot*, *pudding and souse* (pickled pork and sweet potato pudding; Saturday only tradition), *conkies* (steamed sweet corn and coconut pudding wrapped in banana leaf; October–November during Independence celebrations), black cake (Christmas rum fruit cake soaked for months)
- **Must-drink** → *rum punch* (the Caribbean formula: one sour, two sweet, three strong, four weak; lime, sugar syrup, rum, water + angostura bitters), *Mount Gay XO* (the benchmark aged rum), *Banks* lager (ice cold), *mauby* (bitter bark drink made from the mauby tree; an acquired taste but the most Bajan non-alcoholic drink), *coconut water* from a roadside vendor, *sorrel* (hibiscus drink at Christmas)
- **Costs** → Barbados is the most expensive island in the Caribbean; comparable to US/European prices; budget €80–120/day for mid-range travel; street food and rum shops offer better value; supermarkets are cheaper than eating out; Friday fish fry is excellent value
- **Safety** → Barbados is one of the safest islands in the Caribbean; violent crime against tourists is rare; petty theft exists in tourist areas (especially Bridgetown and cruise ship areas); Bridgetown at night requires normal urban awareness; the Gap and tourist beach areas are generally safe; beach vendors can be persistent but non-threatening
- **Local customs** → Barbadians are famously polite and formal; greet people with "good morning/afternoon/evening" before any interaction; dress modestly when away from the beach (swimwear only at the beach, not in shops/restaurants); Sunday church service is important to many families; punctuality is flexible
- **COVID-19 recovery** → tourism recovered strongly by 2023; pre-pandemic visitor numbers exceeded by 2024; digital nomad visa program (Welcome Stamp) launched in 2020 attracts remote workers to stay 12 months
- **Emergency** → 211 (police), 511 (ambulance), 311 (fire)
