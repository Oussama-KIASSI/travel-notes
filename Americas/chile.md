# Chile

## Historical Context
**Indigenous Heritage**: Mapuche (largest group, south), Aymara + Atacameño (north), Rapa Nui (Easter Island). Mapuche resisted Inca expansion + Spanish conquest for 300 years until 1880s. Culture, language (Mapudungun), spiritual practices remain vibrant in Lake District + Araucania.

**Colonial Era & Independence**: Spanish colonization from 1541 (Santiago founded). No major gold/silver; relatively poor colony. Independence 1818 under Bernardo O'Higgins. War of the Pacific (1879–1884) against Peru + Bolivia secured northern territories + nitrate deposits.

**Modern History**: Salvador Allende's socialist presidency (1970–1973) ended by Pinochet's CIA-backed coup. Dictatorship (1973–1990): 3,000+ deaths/disappearances, neoliberal economic reforms creating South America's strongest economy. Democracy returned 1990.

**Recent Developments (2019-2024)**: 2019–2020 "Estallido Social" (mass protests over inequality). New constitution proposed, rejected by voters (2022). Gabriel Boric (elected 2021, age 36) = youngest president, leftist coalition. Pension reform contentious. Mapuche land disputes in Araucania persist.
