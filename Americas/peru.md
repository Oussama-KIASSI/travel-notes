# Peru

## Historical Context
**Pre-Inca Civilizations**: Peru hosted some of the Americas' oldest cultures. Norte Chico (Caral, 3000 BCE) contemporaneous with Egyptian pyramids — one of the world's six "cradles of civilization." Successive cultures: Chavín (900 BCE), Nazca (Lines, 200 BCE–600 CE), Moche (ceramics, Huaca de la Luna), Wari (first Andean empire), Chimú (Chan Chan, world's largest adobe city), Tiwanaku. Each developed advanced agriculture, astronomy, textiles, and architecture.

**Inca Empire (Tawantinsuyu)**: Rose from Cusco valley in 13th century; rapid expansion under Pachacuti (1438–1471). At peak: 4,000 km from Colombia to Chile, 40,000 km of roads, 10 million subjects. Achievements: earthquake-resistant mortarless stonework, agricultural terracing, *quipu* record-keeping, freeze-dried *chuño*. Collapsed when European diseases killed millions (including Emperor Huayna Capac), triggering civil war between Atahualpa and Huáscar just before Pizarro arrived.

**Spanish Conquest (1532)**: Pizarro captured Atahualpa at Cajamarca with 168 men against 80,000. Atahualpa filled a room with gold as ransom; Pizarro executed him anyway. Lima founded 1535. Last Inca resistance (Vilcabamba) fell 1572. ~8–10 million indigenous died in first century from disease, warfare, and forced labor.

**Colonial Era (1532-1821)**: Spain's richest colony (Potosí silver). Churches built atop Inca temples. Cusco School art blended European and indigenous aesthetics. Túpac Amaru II's uprising (1780–1781) brutally suppressed.

**Independence & Republic (1821-2000)**: Independence 1821 (San Martín), secured 1824 (Bolívar). Disastrous War of the Pacific (1879–1884) against Chile lost southern territories. 1968–1980 military dictatorship: radical land reform but economic crisis.

**Shining Path & Political Violence (1980-2000)**: Sendero Luminoso insurgency killed 70,000+ (mostly indigenous peasants). Leader Guzmán captured 1992. Fujimori (1990–2000) defeated terrorism but became authoritarian; fled amid corruption. Truth & Reconciliation Commission (2003) documented the period.

**Modern Era (2000-2024)**: Economic growth 2000–2019 based on mining/exports. Chronic political instability: six presidents in six years (2016–2022). Castillo impeached and arrested Dec 2022 for attempting to dissolve congress. Boluarte assumed presidency amid massive protests (50+ killed Jan–Feb 2023). Constitutional crisis continues.

**COVID-19 Impact**: World's highest per-capita death rate. Tourism collapsed 2020–2021; Machu Picchu closed for months. Recovery began 2022 but hasn't reached 2019 levels.

**Geography**: Three regions: *costa* (arid Pacific coast, most population), *sierra* (Andes highlands, indigenous culture center), *selva* (Amazon, 60% of territory, 10% of population). Contains Lake Titicaca (highest navigable lake), dozens of 6,000 m+ peaks, 28 climate zones.
