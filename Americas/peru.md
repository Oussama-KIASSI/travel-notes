# Peru

## Historical Context
**Pre-Inca Civilizations**: Peru hosted some of the Americas' oldest and most sophisticated cultures millennia before the Incas. The Norte Chico civilization (Caral, 3000 BCE) was contemporaneous with Egyptian pyramids, making it one of the world's six "cradles of civilization." Successive cultures included: Chavín (900 BCE, religious center), Nazca (famous for the Lines, 200 BCE-600 CE), Moche (sophisticated ceramics and metalwork, massive pyramids like Huaca de la Luna), Wari (first Andean empire, 600-1000 CE), Chimú (skilled metallurgists, Chan Chan was the world's largest adobe city), and Tiwanaku (shared with Bolivia). Each culture developed advanced agriculture, astronomy, textiles, and architecture.

**Inca Empire (Tawantinsuyu)**: The Incas rose in the 13th century from Cusco valley, but their rapid expansion came under Pachacuti (1438-1471), who conquered vast territories and redesigned Cusco. At its peak (1530s), the Inca Empire stretched 4,000 km from Colombia to Chile, connected by 40,000 km of roads, with 10 million subjects speaking dozens of languages. Achievements included: earthquake-resistant architecture (no mortar, precisely cut stones), agricultural terracing, *quipu* (knotted-cord recording system), freeze-drying food (*chuño*), and complex administration without written language or the wheel. The empire's collapse was swift: European diseases killed millions (including Emperor Huayna Capac), triggering civil war between sons Atahualpa and Huáscar just as Pizarro arrived.

**Spanish Conquest (1532)**: Francisco Pizarro captured Atahualpa at Cajamarca with 168 men against 80,000 Incas, exploiting civil war, superior weapons, horses, and indigenous allies (many peoples resented Inca rule). Despite Atahualpa filling a room with gold as ransom, Pizarro executed him. The Spanish established Lima (1535) as their capital instead of highland Cusco. The last Inca resistance state, Vilcabamba, fell in 1572. An estimated 8-10 million indigenous people died in the first century (90% mortality) from disease, warfare, forced labor in mines (*mita* system), and *encomienda* exploitation.

**Colonial Era (1532-1821)**: Peru became Spain's richest colony due to silver from Potosí (in modern Bolivia, then part of Peru viceroyalty). The Catholic Church converted indigenous people, often building churches directly atop Inca temples. The *Quito School* and *Cusco School* developed distinctive colonial art blending European and indigenous aesthetics. Indigenous rebellions occurred throughout, most notably Túpac Amaru II's uprising (1780-1781), brutally suppressed. The 18th-century Bourbon reforms attempted modernization but increased resentment.

**Independence & Republic (1821-2000)**: Peru declared independence in 1821 (José de San Martín), secured in 1824 (Simón Bolívar's forces). The 19th century saw political chaos, economic struggles, and territorial losses: the guano boom and bust, the disastrous War of the Pacific (1879-1884) against Chile (Peru lost its southern territories and nitrate wealth), and border conflicts with Ecuador. The 20th century brought modernization, urbanization, but also inequality. The 1968-1980 military dictatorship under Velasco implemented radical land reform, nationalizations, and indigenous recognition but caused economic crisis.

**Shining Path & Political Violence (1980-2000)**: The Maoist terrorist group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) launched an insurgency in 1980, leading to Peru's darkest period. The conflict killed 70,000+ people (mostly indigenous peasants caught between guerrillas and military). State forces committed systematic human rights abuses; entire villages were massacred. Sendero's leader Abimael Guzmán was captured in 1992. President Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000) defeated terrorism but became increasingly authoritarian, eventually fleeing to Japan amid corruption scandals. Truth & Reconciliation Commission (2003) documented the horror.

**Modern Era (2000-2024)**: Peru experienced economic growth (2000-2019) based on mining, fishing, and exports, lifting millions from poverty but increasing inequality and environmental damage. Political instability became chronic: Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned (2018), Martín Vizcarra was impeached (2020), Manuel Merino resigned after 5 days amid protests killing 2 (Nov 2020), Francisco Sagasti served as transitional president (2020-2021), Pedro Castillo (rural schoolteacher, leftist) won narrow election (2021) but was impeached and arrested for attempting to dissolve congress (Dec 2022), Dina Boluarte (VP) assumed presidency amid massive protests, especially in southern highlands (50+ killed Jan-Feb 2023). Constitutional crisis continues with low trust in institutions.

**COVID-19 Impact**: Peru had the world's highest per-capita COVID-19 death rate due to healthcare system collapse, informal economy forcing people to work, and political chaos (3 presidents in 2020). Tourism collapsed 2020-2021; Machu Picchu closed for months. Recovery began 2022 but tourism hasn't fully returned to 2019 levels. Oxygen shortages and mass graves traumatized the nation.

**Geography**: Peru is South America's third-largest country with three distinct regions: *costa* (arid Pacific coast with most population), *sierra* (Andes highlands, center of indigenous culture), and *selva* (Amazon rainforest, 60% of territory but 10% of population). Contains part of the Amazon basin, Lake Titicaca (world's highest navigable lake), and dozens of 6,000m+ peaks. Peru has 28 distinct climate zones and is one of the world's most biodiverse countries.

## Tips — Peru
- **Altitude** → Cusco = 3,400 m; Puno = 3,810 m; Rainbow Mountain = 5,200 m; spend 2-3 nights in Cusco before any strenuous activity (Machu Picchu, Rainbow Mountain, Ausangate); *soroche* (altitude sickness) is real and can be severe: headaches, nausea, dizziness, insomnia, shortness of breath; drink 3-4L water/day; avoid alcohol + heavy meals first 48 hrs; walk slowly; rest frequently
- **Altitude medication** → acetazolamide (Diamox) helps acclimatization; take 125-250mg 2x/day starting 1-2 days before ascent; ask your doctor; available at Cusco pharmacies without prescription; side effects include tingling, increased urination, metallic taste in carbonated drinks
- **Coca tea (*mate de coca*)** → traditional remedy for altitude; legal in Peru (not in most other countries); drink 3-4 cups/day; chewing coca leaves (*chacchar*) more effective; buy at any market; not the same as cocaine; culturally important in Andean communities
- **Altitude emergency signs** → severe headache not relieved by painkillers, confusion, loss of coordination, shortness of breath at rest, fluid in lungs (crackles when breathing), blue lips/fingernails → descend immediately + seek medical help; can be fatal if ignored (HACE/HAPE)
- **Machu Picchu** → book train (PeruRail, Inca Rail from Ollantaytambo or Poroy) + entrance tickets months ahead (especially Apr-Oct); daily visitor caps strict (5,600/day split into entry times); choose 6 AM slot for mist, fewer crowds, and best photos; Huayna Picchu permits (400/day) sell out 3-6 months ahead; bring passport (required for entry); no large bags allowed; bottled water in plastic bottles prohibited (bring refillable); entrance fees expensive ($50+ USD, higher for foreigners than Peruvians)
- **Inca Trail** → 4-day trek to Machu Picchu (43 km); max 500 people/day total (200 tourists, 300 porters/guides); sells out 6 months in advance for peak season (Jun-Aug); must book through licensed agency; permit $70 + tour $500-800; best May–Oct (dry season); closed entire February for trail maintenance; alternative treks: Salkantay (5 days, no permit needed), Lares (3-4 days, hot springs), Choquequirao (4-5 days, Peru's "other Machu Picchu")
- **Safety** → exercise caution in Lima Centro (after dark), Callao (port, avoid entirely), Cusco's San Blas at night; use app taxis only (InDriver, Uber, Cabify, Beat); never hail street taxis; avoid displaying phones, cameras, jewelry; pickpockets very active in tourist areas (Cusco main plaza, buses, markets); bag slashing on buses; keep valuables in front; political protests can shut down roads/cities (especially in southern highlands post-2022)
- **Protest risk** → southern Peru (Puno, Arequipa, Cusco region) experienced violent protests 2022-2023 against President Boluarte; roads blocked, airports closed, tourists stranded; check news before travel; register with embassy; build buffer days into itinerary; protests could recur with political instability
- **Emergency** → police 105, ambulance 106, fire 116; tourist police in major cities speak English; report thefts for insurance claims; medical care better in Lima than provinces
- **Must-eat** → ceviche (raw fish in lime juice, onions, chili — national dish), lomo saltado (stir-fried beef with fries), causa (layered potato-avocado-chicken), ají de gallina (creamy chicken in yellow chili sauce), anticuchos (beef heart skewers), cuy (guinea pig), rocoto relleno (stuffed spicy peppers), adobo arequipeño (pork stew), picarones (pumpkin-squash doughnuts in syrup), papa rellena (stuffed fried potato)
- **Must-drink** → pisco sour (national cocktail: pisco brandy, lime juice, egg white, bitters), *chicha morada* (purple corn drink with pineapple, cinnamon, cloves), *mate de coca* (coca leaf tea), *Inca Kola* (fluorescent yellow soda, tastes like bubble gum, outsells Coca-Cola in Peru), *chicha de jora* (fermented corn beer, ancient Inca drink), *cremolada* (shaved ice fruit drink)
- **Pisco** → Peru's national spirit (grape brandy); main regions: Ica, Pisco; DO NOT mention Chilean pisco in Peru (bitter rivalry); classic pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco (stronger than Chilean version), no egg white in Chilean version; *pisco acholado* (blend of grapes) best for sours
- **Food safety** → street food generally safe in busy stalls with high turnover; avoid raw vegetables washed in tap water; ceviche from established restaurants safe; drink bottled water only; ice in tourist areas usually safe (made from purified water)
- **Indigenous culture** → Quechua (8-10 million speakers) is co-official with Spanish; many Andean communities maintain traditional dress (women's layered skirts, shawls, hats indicate region); ask before photographing people (offer small tip if they agree); respect *apachetas* (stone cairns, sacred sites), *Pachamama* offerings (flower petals, coca leaves at mountain passes)
- **Festivals** → Inti Raymi (June 24, Cusco — Inca sun festival reenactment, massive), Qoyllur Rit'i (May-Jun, Cusco — indigenous pilgrimage to sacred glacier, 10,000+ people), Virgen de la Candelaria (Feb, Puno — 2 weeks of dancing, UNESCO), Señor de los Milagros (Oct, Lima — purple-clad pilgrims)
- **Shopping** → bargaining expected in markets, not stores; best buys: alpaca wool (sweaters, blankets, scarves — test by burning fiber; real alpaca smells like hair, acrylic melts), textiles (Cusco, Pisac market), silver (handcrafted jewelry), pottery (Chulucanas), *retablos* (traditional folk art boxes)
- **Transport** → domestic flights (LATAM, Sky Airline, Viva Air, Star Peru) save enormous time; Lima–Cusco = 1.5 hrs by air vs 20+ hrs by bus; flights often delayed/cancelled in rainy season; long-distance buses good quality for overnight (Cruz del Sur, Oltursa — 160-180° reclining seats, meals included); local buses slow, crowded, unsafe; collectivo minivans faster for short routes
- **Money** → Peruvian Sol (PEN); $1 USD ≈ 3.7-4 PEN (fluctuates); USD widely accepted in tourist areas but poor exchange rate; ATMs plentiful in cities (withdraw at bank ATMs, not street machines); credit cards accepted in upscale establishments; bring cash for markets, street food, taxis, rural areas; small bills essential (20-50 PEN)
- **Tipping** → 10% service charge sometimes included; add 5-10% tip for good service; not expected in basic restaurants; round up taxi fares; tip trekking guides/porters (standard: $20-25/guide per day, $10-15/porter per day on Inca Trail)
- **Language** → Spanish with Peruvian slang (*pata* = friend, *jato* = house, *jama* = food, *chamba* = work); coastal Spanish faster/clearer than Andean; Quechua spoken in highlands (learning basic phrases appreciated: *allillanchu* = how are you?, *yusulpayki* = thank you)
- **Visas** → most nationalities get 90 days on arrival; passport must be valid for 6+ months on entry; extensions possible at immigration offices; overstaying fine of $1/day
- **Health** → yellow fever vaccine recommended for Amazon (required for some lodges); dengue, malaria risk in jungle/northern coast; typhoid, hepatitis A vaccines recommended; altitude sickness most common health issue; traveler's diarrhea common (bring Imodium, electrolytes); rabies risk from stray dogs (don't pet them)
- **Electricity** → 220V (Lima uses 220V, some areas 110V); US-style flat plugs Type A/B, sometimes Type C (European round); bring adapter
- **Internet** → WiFi widely available in hotels, restaurants, cafes; mobile data good in cities, spotty in Sacred Valley/remote areas; local SIM cards cheap (Claro, Movistar, Bitel)
- **Best time to visit by activity** → trekking (May-Sep), ceviche (year-round but best in summer Dec-Mar when fish fattest), Amazon wildlife (dry season Jun-Nov for easier spotting), surfing (Mar-Dec, north coast year-round), condors at Colca (Apr-Nov, best May-Aug)
- **Political context** → Peru's democracy is fragile with institutional crisis; low trust in congress (10% approval); corruption widespread; six presidents in six years (2016-2022); Boluarte faces calls to resign; new elections possible; generally doesn't affect tourists except during major protests
