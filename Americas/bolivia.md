# Bolivia

## Historical Context
**Ancient Civilizations**: **Tiwanaku Empire (500-1000 CE)** near Lake Titicaca predates Incas by 500+ years. Massive ceremonial center with sophisticated agriculture and monumental architecture. Incas conquered the region in the 15th century, incorporating Aymara and Quechua peoples.

**Colonial Era**: Silver discovered at Cerro Rico, Potosi (1545). Potosi became largest city in the Americas by 1650 (pop. 200,000; larger than London/Paris). ~8 million indigenous + African slaves died mining. "Worth a Potosi" = synonym for immense wealth in Spanish.

**Modern History**: Independence 1825 (named after Simon Bolivar). Lost Pacific coastline to Chile (War of the Pacific, 1879-1884; still deeply felt). Evo Morales (2006-2019): first indigenous president in Latin America; nationalized gas, rewrote constitution recognizing 36 indigenous nations. Controversial resignation 2019; Luis Arce elected 2020 continuing MAS party. Recent: COVID-19 impact, lithium development in Uyuni (world's largest reserves), ongoing indigenous land rights tensions.

**Indigenous Culture**: 55% identify as indigenous (highest in South America); primarily Aymara + Quechua. *Wiphala* (rainbow checkered flag) = official state symbol. Coca leaf chewing, *ch'alla* rituals to Pachamama, traditional medicine through *yatiris* remain central to daily life.

- **Altitude strategy** → fly into La Paz, spend 2 days acclimatizing before going higher
  - El Alto airport (4,061 m) is higher than the city; taxi down immediately
  - Avoid Potosi as first stop; ascend gradually
- **Uyuni tours** → book reputable multi-day 4x4 tour from Uyuni or San Pedro de Atacama
  - Cross-border Atacama–Uyuni tour is a great road trip
  - Avoid cheapest operators (breakdowns, unsafe driving common)
  - Check vehicle condition, group size + meals; bring warm sleeping bag (nights -15°C)
