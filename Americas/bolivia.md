# Bolivia

## Historical Context
**Ancient Civilizations**: Bolivia's highlands were home to the **Tiwanaku Empire (500-1000 CE)**, one of the most important pre-Columbian civilizations in the Americas, which predates the Incas by over 500 years. Their capital near Lake Titicaca was a massive ceremonial center with sophisticated agriculture, astronomical knowledge, and monumental architecture. The Incas later conquered the region in the 15th century, incorporating the Aymara and Quechua peoples into their empire.

**Colonial Era**: The discovery of silver at Cerro Rico in Potosí (1545) transformed Bolivia into the economic engine of the Spanish Empire. Potosí became the largest, wealthiest city in the Americas (population 200,000 by 1650), larger than London or Paris at the time. An estimated 8 million indigenous people and African slaves died mining the mountain. The phrase "worth a Potosí" entered Spanish as a synonym for unimaginable wealth.

**Modern History**: Bolivia achieved independence in 1825, named after Simón Bolívar. The 20th century saw the loss of its Pacific coastline to Chile (War of the Pacific, 1879-1884)—a loss still deeply felt. Bolivia had Latin America's first indigenous president, Evo Morales (2006-2019), who nationalized natural gas, rewrote the constitution to recognize 36 indigenous nations, and lifted millions out of poverty. His controversial resignation in 2019 amid election disputes led to political turmoil, followed by Luis Arce's election in 2020, continuing the MAS party's economic nationalism. Recent developments (2020-2024) include COVID-19's severe impact, lithium development in the Uyuni salt flats (Bolivia has world's largest reserves), and ongoing tensions over indigenous land rights and resource extraction.

**Indigenous Culture**: 55% of Bolivians identify as indigenous (highest proportion in South America)—primarily Aymara and Quechua. The *wiphala* (rainbow checkered flag) is an official state symbol alongside the tricolor. Indigenous practices like coca leaf chewing, *ch'alla* rituals to Pachamama (Mother Earth), and traditional medicine through *yatiris* (spiritual healers) remain central to daily life, even in cities.

## Tips — Bolivia
- **Altitude** → La Paz = 3,640 m; Potosí = 4,090 m; Salar de Uyuni = 3,656 m; acclimatize seriously; take the first day completely easy; coca tea + coca leaves help; expect shortness of breath, headaches + fatigue for 24-48 hrs; avoid alcohol on arrival; stay hydrated (3-4L water/day); some travelers use *sorochi pills* (available at any pharmacy); serious symptoms require descent + medical attention
- **Altitude acclimatization strategy** → fly into La Paz, spend 2 days acclimatizing before going higher; the city's airport (El Alto, 4,061 m) is higher than the city itself — taxi down immediately; avoid Potosí (4,090 m) as your first stop; ascend gradually; sleep lower than you climb if possible
- **Uyuni tours** → book a reputable multi-day 4x4 tour from Uyuni or San Pedro de Atacama (Chile); the cross-border tour from Atacama–Uyuni is one of the great road trips; avoid the cheapest operators (vehicle breakdowns, poor food, unsafe driving are common); check vehicle condition, group size + meal plans before booking; bring warm sleeping bag (nights drop to -15°C); shared bathrooms are basic; diesel fumes inside 4x4s can cause nausea
- **Geography** → Bolivia has the most extreme topography in South America: Amazon rainforest (16% of territory), high-altitude Altiplano plateau (3,000-4,000 m), and soaring Andean peaks; no navigable river to the sea since losing its coastline; landlocked status deeply affects national identity
- **Must-eat** → salteñas (morning empanadas — the national snack), silpancho, sopa de maní, pique macho (chopped beef + sausage + peppers + fries), llama steak, quinua dishes
- **Must-drink** → singani (Bolivia's national spirit, similar to pisco), *api* (hot purple corn drink), *chicha* (fermented corn beer; artisanal; offered in homes with a white flag outside)
- **Indigenous markets** → every Andean town has a weekly market day; bargaining expected but be respectful; best for textiles, weavings, alpaca wool, silver jewelry; try *k'oa* (dried herbs for rituals), *coca leaves* (legal and culturally important)
- **Language** → Spanish is dominant but 36% speak Aymara as first language, 25% Quechua; learning basic Aymara greetings (*jilata* = brother, *kullaka* = sister) appreciated in rural areas
- **Safety** → La Paz is generally safe in tourist areas; watch belongings on the teleférico + in markets; political protests are common — avoid blockades; road blockages (*bloqueos*) can strand travelers for days — check local news; avoid walking alone late at night in El Alto
- **Political context (2020-2024)** → post-Evo Morales era brought volatility; Luis Arce (elected 2020) continued MAS economic policies; tensions over lithium extraction, indigenous land rights + judicial independence persist; protests occasionally close airports/roads
- **COVID-19 impact** → severe toll (highest per-capita death rate in region); healthcare system strained; vaccination rates improved by 2023; tourism rebounded slowly; some smaller agencies closed permanently
- **Visas** → some nationalities (incl. US) pay a reciprocal fee at the border; check in advance
- **Money** → ATMs widely available in cities; bring USD cash for rural areas + Uyuni tours; credit cards accepted in upscale establishments only; street money changers offer better rates than banks
- **Transport** → long-distance buses are cheap but slow (La Paz-Uyuni = 10-12 hrs); book better companies (Todo Turismo, Trans Copacabana) for safety; domestic flights save time (Amaszonas, BoA) but less reliable scheduling; collectivo minivans faster than buses for shorter routes
