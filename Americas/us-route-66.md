# Route 66 — USA

## Overview
The original American highway; 3,940 km (2,448 miles) from Chicago, Illinois to Santa Monica, California. Passes through 8 states: Illinois → Missouri → Kansas (13 miles) → Oklahoma → Texas → New Mexico → Arizona → California. Decommissioned 1985 but survives as Historic Route 66 frontage roads. Allow 14–21 days for the full drive; 10 days possible but rushed. Inspired Steinbeck's *Grapes of Wrath*, Bobby Troup's "(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66" and Pixar's *Cars*.

## Historical Context and Americana

**Birth of the Mother Road (1926)**: Commissioned 1926 as part of the first national road network. Cyrus Avery lobbied to route it through Oklahoma. Number "66" chosen almost arbitrarily (Route 60 was taken). Not fully paved until 1938.

**The Dust Bowl Migration (1930s)**: 2.5 million people fled the ecological catastrophe of the southern Great Plains. Steinbeck's *Grapes of Wrath* (1939) immortalized the Joad family's journey. Peak migration 1935–1940. Migrants faced hostility in California — called "Okies," lived in squalid camps.

**WWII and Post-War Boom (1941–1970)**: WWII moved soldiers/materials along Route 66 to West Coast. Post-war: cheap gas, car culture, paid vacations created the American road trip. Bobby Troup's 1946 song made the highway iconic. The road spawned motor courts, diners, roadside oddities, neon signs, and Googie architecture.

**The Interstate System and Decline (1956–1985)**: Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System (1956) bypassed small towns. Last segment bypassed 1984 (Williams, AZ). Officially decommissioned Jun 27, 1985. Towns died overnight.

**Revival and Nostalgia (1990–present)**: Designated National Scenic Byway 1990. Angel Delgadillo (Seligman barber) founded Historic Route 66 Association 1987. Revival driven by foreign tourists (especially German and Japanese). Pixar's *Cars* (2006) introduced it to a new generation — Radiator Springs based on Seligman, Williams and others.

**What Route 66 Represents**: America in microcosm — migration, opportunity, capitalism, obsolescence, nostalgia. The open road as freedom; the small-town café as community; the neon sign as art.

**Modern Developments (2020–2025)**:
- **COVID-19 (2020–2021)**: Devastated small-town businesses; many closed permanently. Recovery began summer 2021 as Americans rediscovered domestic road trips — record traffic 2021–2022.
- **Federal Recognition (2021)**: "Route 66 National Historic Trail Act" introduced; bipartisan but not yet passed. Would unlock federal preservation funding.
- **EV Charging (2022–2025)**: Stations appearing (NM state-funded corridor, Tesla Superchargers in Barstow/Kingman/Flagstaff). Longest gap: Seligman to Kingman (70+ miles).
- **Inflation + Gas (2021–2024)**: Gas prices peaked in 2022. Fuel costs increased significantly over this period.
- **Preservation Wins**: U-Drop Inn (Shamrock, TX) fully restored 2023. Munger Moss Motel sold 2021 to preservation-committed owners. Elmer's Bottle Tree Ranch donated to trust 2019.
- **TikTok Effect (2022–2024)**: Route 66 went viral; younger demographic now visiting. Overtourism at Cadillac Ranch and Blue Whale on weekends.

## State-by-State Highlights and Culture

**Illinois (Chicago to Missouri, ~470 km)**: Urban beginning transitions to Midwestern farmland (Corn Belt). Small-town Illinois politically conservative, economically struggling. Abraham Lincoln presence everywhere in Springfield (lived 1844–1861). Most heavily restored section — murals, vintage signs throughout.

**Missouri (St. Louis to Joplin, ~500 km)**: Ozarks define southern Missouri — forested hills, 6,000+ caves, rivers, Scots-Irish heritage. Bible Belt (Baptist/Pentecostal). Meramec River valley (Devil's Elbow) is most scenic stretch east of the Rockies. Missouri BBQ: burnt ends, sweet sauces, KC vs St. Louis rivalry.

**Kansas (Galena to Baxter Springs, 21 km)**: Shortest section (13.2 miles). Former lead-zinc mining country (Tri-State Mining District). Mining peaked 1900s–1950s; died by 1970. *Cars* connection revived Galena's tourism.

**Oklahoma (Joplin to Amarillo, ~650 km)**: Heart of Route 66 — most drivable original miles. 39 federally recognized tribes (Oklahoma = "red people" in Choctaw). Trail of Tears relocations; 1889 Land Run. Dust Bowl hit hardest here. Oil industry boomed 1920s–30s (Tulsa = "Oil Capital"). Deeply conservative, Bible Belt. Landscape shifts from green hills (east) to red plains (center) to shortgrass prairie (west).

**Texas (Amarillo, 300 km Panhandle)**: High Plains; flat, treeless ranching country at 3,500–4,000 ft. Amarillo is a cattle auction/meatpacking center. Palo Duro Canyon: 800 ft deep anomaly in the flatness. Cadillac Ranch + Big Texan represent Texas-scale spectacle. Former Comanche territory until Red River War (1874–1875).

**New Mexico (Tucumcari to Gallup, ~650 km)**: Most culturally distinct section. 50% Hispanic, 11% Native American. High desert (Albuquerque at 5,300 ft). Santa Fe founded 1610 (oldest US capital). Taos Pueblo continuously inhabited 1,000+ years. Green chile is state religion (60%+ of US chile production). Mix of Pueblo, Spanish colonial, Mexican, and nuclear-age culture (Los Alamos).

**Arizona (Holbrook to CA border, ~650 km)**: High desert and Colorado Plateau — Painted Desert, petrified forests, volcanic fields. Navajo Nation (27,000 sq mi). Flagstaff at 7,000 ft — mountain town, liberal college culture. Seligman to Oatman through Black Mountains: steepest, most dramatic drive on the route. Mojave Desert begins at CA border.

**California (Mojave to Santa Monica, ~500 km)**: Mojave crossing: 120°F+ in summer; Amboy alignment is remote and surreal. Cajon Pass drops from 4,000 ft to sea level in 30 miles. Route enters LA through San Bernardino, Pasadena, Hollywood. Santa Monica Pier endpoint: anticlimactic but symbolically powerful.

## Tips — Route 66
- **Gas** → never pass a station in AZ/NM desert; stations 80+ km apart
  - Seligman to Kingman: no services 50+ miles; Amboy to Barstow: 70+ miles, no guaranteed open stations
- **Water** → carry 4+ L per person in AZ/CA desert; summer car trouble can be life-threatening
  - Mojave regularly exceeds 120°F Jul–Aug
- **Speed** → frontage roads 45–65 mph; small towns fund themselves through traffic tickets; radar ubiquitous
- **Cash** → many authentic stops are cash-only; keep small bills available
  - Owl Bar (NM), Delgadillo's Snow Cap (AZ), many vintage motels
- **Photography** → best neon shots at dusk (30 min after sunset); golden hour in desert
  - Blue Swallow (Tucumcari), Wigwam Motels, U-Drop Inn (Shamrock) best at twilight
  - Sunrise at Cadillac Ranch for best light; bring real camera (phones struggle with night/distance)
- **Cell service** → spotty; Verizon/AT&T best coverage; Mojave + Seligman–Kingman stretch has long gaps
  - Download offline maps before leaving cities
- **Lodging** → book iconic motels 6+ months ahead for summer; chain motels available
  - Avoid night driving in remote areas — wildlife (deer, elk, cattle) on roads
- **Route 66 vs. Interstates** → interstates faster (70–80 mph) but sterile; Route 66 frontage roads slower (45–55 mph) but where the culture is
  - Alternate between them; EZ66 Guide details every turn
- **Must-eat** → green chile cheeseburger (NM, Owl Bar), Chicago deep-dish (Lou Malnati's), Oklahoma BBQ, Navajo taco (fry bread + beans + chile), TX brisket, In-N-Out Animal Style (CA), Ted Drewes concrete (St. Louis), MidPoint Café pies (Adrian, TX)

- **Cultural notes** → Route 66 crosses deep red (Republican) America; avoid politics/religion talk
  - Conversations with strangers at diners expected; Americans friendly and talkative
  - Tipping mandatory: 15–20% restaurants, $1–2/drink at bars, $1–2/bag at hotels
- **Books + media** → *Grapes of Wrath* (Steinbeck) — read before trip; *On the Road* (Kerouac); *EZ66 Guide* (McClanahan) — essential practical guide; *Route 66: The Mother Road* (Wallis); Pixar's *Cars*; "(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66" (Nat King Cole, Chuck Berry, Rolling Stones versions)
- **Safety** → generally safe; lock car, don't leave valuables visible
  - Wildlife on roads at dawn/dusk causes fatal accidents; never approach wild animals
  - Mojave abandoned buildings hazardous (collapsing floors, snakes)
  - Desert breakdown in 120°F heat is life-threatening; prepare accordingly
- **Emergency** → 911; carry satellite communicator (Garmin inReach/SPOT) for remote desert
  - AAA road assistance recommended; US healthcare expensive — buy travel insurance ($10K+ for broken leg, $1K–3K ambulance)
- **Budget** → plan ahead for accommodations, meals, and national park access
  - Costs vary by season and booking strategy
  - Budget extra for souvenirs and attractions
