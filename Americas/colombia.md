# Colombia

## Overview
Caribbean beaches to Andean peaks to Amazon jungle. World's second most biodiverse country (10% of Earth's species in 1% of land area). 87 indigenous ethnic groups + Afro-Colombian coastal communities. 2016 peace agreement with FARC ended 52 years of conflict, opening new regions. Medellin's transformation from most dangerous city to innovation hub symbolizes national renewal.

## Historical Context
Pre-Columbian cultures: Muisca (El Dorado legend), Tayrona, Quimbaya, San Agustin. Spanish conquest from 1499; Cartagena became richest port in Spanish Empire. Independence 1819 under Bolivar. 20th century: La Violencia (1948–1958; 200,000+ killed), drug cartels (Escobar's Medellin Cartel 1980s–90s), guerrilla conflict (FARC, ELN). 2016 peace agreement ended most FARC activity. Gustavo Petro elected 2022 (former guerrilla; first leftist president); emphasis on social programs + environment.

## Safety & Political Updates (2020–2025)
**COVID-19 Impact**: Strict lockdowns 2020–2021. Tourism fully recovered by 2023. Vaccination proof no longer required as of 2024.

**Political Situation**: Petro presidency (2022–present); focus on rural development + coca substitution. Stable democratic institutions. ELN peace process ongoing but fragile. Some former FARC dissidents active in remote areas (not tourist regions).

**Safety for Travelers**: Major destinations (Bogota, Medellin, Cartagena, Coffee Region, Tayrona) safe with standard precautions.
