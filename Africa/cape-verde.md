# Cape Verde

## Overview
An Atlantic archipelago of 10 islands and 8 islets, 570 km off the coast of Senegal. Discovered uninhabited by Portuguese navigators in 1456 (though some evidence suggests earlier Moorish or Phoenician contact). Became a crucial node in the Atlantic slave trade — the first enslaved Africans in the Americas were trans-shipped through Cidade Velha starting in 1462. The population is almost entirely Creole (mixed Portuguese-African heritage) with a unique culture neither fully African nor European. Portuguese-speaking, historically tied to the African continent but culturally and geographically Atlantic. Independent from Portugal since 1975. Each island has a distinct character: Sal and Boa Vista are flat, desert-like resort islands with world-class beaches and kite/windsurfing; Santiago is the historical and political heart; São Vicente has the country's richest music and cultural life; Santo Antão is a hiker's paradise of dramatic volcanic mountains; Fogo has an active volcano and extraordinary wine. The national soul is the music called *morna* — a fado-like genre of longing and distance (*sodade*), the art form of Cesária Évora, who sang barefoot and brought Cape Verdean culture to the world before her death in 2011.

## Tips — Cape Verde
- **Inter-island transport** → TACV/Bestfly Cabo Verde Airlines + **Binter Cabo Verde** (more reliable); delays common
  - Book early for island-hopping; ferries slow + unreliable (frequently suspended)
  - São Vicente–Santo Antão ferry (Porto Novo; 1 hr) = only consistently operating ferry; scenic crossing
- **Language** → Portuguese (official) + Cape Verdean Creole (*Kriolu*; 95% first language; each island has own dialect)
  - Kriolu not mutually intelligible with Portuguese
  - Useful: *modi ki bu sta?* / *stão ben?* = how are you?; *obrigadu/a* = thank you; *tchau* = bye; *bondia/botardi/bonoiti* = good morning/afternoon/night
  - English spoken in tourist areas; Spanish not understood
- **Currency** → Cape Verdean Escudo (CVE); pegged to Euro
  - Cash essential outside main tourist hotels; ATMs in Santa Maria, Sal Rei, Praia, Mindelo + larger towns
  - Take sufficient cash before leaving main towns
- **Water** → tap water not reliably safe on any island; use bottled water for drinking + brushing teeth
  - UV purifier (Steripen) practical for extended stays; water scarcity is chronic
- **Safety** → one of the safest countries in Africa; violent crime against tourists very rare
  - Petty theft/bag snatching in Praia (Platô after dark, Sucupira Market) + some in Mindelo; normal urban precautions
  - Ocean swimming: powerful Atlantic rips on exposed beaches (Santa Mónica, Ponta Preta); drownings occur; heed local warnings
  - Hiking: steep trails on Santo Antão + Fogo; adequate water, sun protection, proper footwear essential
- **Sun** → UV extreme at 15°N latitude + reflection off sand/water; SPF 50+ and hat non-negotiable
  - Trade winds disguise burn intensity; reapply every 2 hrs; sunburn + heatstroke common among unprepared tourists
- **Emigration and diaspora** → 700,000 abroad vs 550,000 on islands; emigration constant since 19th c (drought, famine, lack of opportunity)
  - Remittances = major national income; *sodade* (longing) = defining emotion of culture + morna music
- **Must-eat** → *cachupa* (national dish; every recipe differs), *pastel de atum*, fresh grilled tuna, *caldeirada* (seafood stew), *percebes* (goose barnacles; Santo Antão/Fogo delicacy), *polvo grelhado* (grilled octopus), *queijo de cabra* (goat cheese, esp. Santo Antão), *xerém* (cornmeal with fish), *caldo de peixe* (fish soup)
- **Must-drink** → *grogue* (raw from Santo Antão; aged in Mindelo), *ponche* (grogue + honey + lime), Fogo volcanic wine, *café* (strong; Cape Verde grows Arabica in Santo Antão + Fogo valleys), sunset *grog* on Boa Vista beach, *strela* or *kriola* beer (local lagers; Strela brewed on São Vicente)
- **Music** → listen to Cesária Évora (*Sodade*, *Petit Pays*, *Mar Azul*) before you go
  - Live morna in small Mindelo restaurant = worth the entire trip
  - Also: *funaná* (accordion dance music; banned by colonial authorities; now identity symbol), *coladeira* (uptempo), *batuque* (Badiu women's percussion from Santiago), *tabanka* (processional)
- **Turtles** → Boa Vista: 3rd most important loggerhead nesting site (after Florida + Oman); 15,000–20,000 nests/year
  - Always use authorized guide (BIOS.CV); never approach nests; no torches or flashes
  - Tour funds monitoring, nest protection, anti-poaching patrols
- **Environmental challenges** → vulnerable to climate change (rising seas, changing ocean temps, drought, desertification, plastic pollution)
  - Conservation: sea turtle programs, reforestation, renewable energy (wind + solar on Sal + Santiago)
- **Costs** → moderate by African standards, reasonable by European
  - Sal + Boa Vista most expensive (resort-focused); Santo Antão, Fogo, Santiago = better value
- **COVID-19 recovery** → tourism recovered by 2023; pre-pandemic numbers (800,000/yr) exceeded by 2024
  - New resort developments on Sal + Boa Vista; government promoting Santo Antão hiking + Mindelo cultural tourism
