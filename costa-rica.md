# Costa Rica

## Overview
Costa Rica is Central America's success story—a stable democracy, no standing army since 1949, and world leader in ecotourism and sustainability. Despite being smaller than West Virginia, Costa Rica contains 5% of Earth's biodiversity. Over 25% of the country is protected in national parks and reserves. The nation pioneered "green tourism" in the 1980s-90s. Two coastlines (Pacific and Caribbean), cloud forests, active volcanoes, and rainforest make Costa Rica extraordinarily diverse. The culture emphasizes "pura vida" (pure life)—a philosophy of contentment, peace, and appreciation. Costa Rica has the highest life expectancy in the Americas and ranks consistently among the world's happiest countries. Tourism is the primary industry; infrastructure is well-developed. Strong environmental protections have restored forest cover from 20% (1980s) to 60% (2020s)—a conservation triumph.

## Historical Context
Pre-Columbian Costa Rica had small indigenous populations (Bribri, Cabécar, Boruca) compared to neighbors; less centralized than Aztec/Inca civilizations. Spanish arrived 1502 (Columbus's fourth voyage); the "Rich Coast" name proved ironic—little gold or exploitable labor. Colonial period was relatively peaceful; isolated province. Independence came 1821 (part of brief Mexican Empire, then Central American Federation). Costa Rica became independent republic 1838. Coffee exports (1830s+) brought prosperity. Democracy established early; escaped Central America's civil war pattern. 1948 civil war (6 weeks; 2,000 dead) led to new constitution; President José Figueres Ferrer abolished the army (1949), invested in education/healthcare. 1970s–80s environmental movement began; national parks created. 1987 President Óscar Arias won Nobel Peace Prize for Central American peace efforts. 1990s–2000s: tech sector growth; Intel opened plant 1998. 2010s: LGBT+ rights expanded; same-sex marriage legalized 2020. COVID-19 (2020–2022) hit tourism hard but recovered by 2023. 2022–2024: economic recovery; carbon-neutral goal by 2050; continued environmental leadership.

## Safety & Political Updates (2020–2025)
**Political Situation**: Stable democracy; President Rodrigo Chaves elected 2022. Democratic institutions strong. No political violence. Some economic challenges (poverty, inequality) but overall prosperous by regional standards. Strong rule of law.

**COVID-19 Impact**: Strict protocols 2020–2021; tourism collapsed. Full reopening 2022. No restrictions remain as of 2024. Tourism infrastructure fully recovered.

**Safety for Travelers**: Costa Rica is Central America's safest country. Violent crime against tourists very rare. Main risks are petty theft (rental car break-ins, bag snatching, pickpocketing) in tourist areas. San José has higher crime than countryside; caution at night. Beach theft common—never leave valuables on beach. Rental car break-ins at trailheads/beaches—leave nothing visible. Pacific coast rip currents dangerous; swim only at flagged beaches. Wildlife generally safe but don't approach (snakes, crocodiles). Solo women travelers report feeling safe with standard precautions. LGBT+ travelers very welcome; same-sex marriage legal since 2020.
